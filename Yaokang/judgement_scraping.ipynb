       "{'AKK15 v Minister for Immigration & Anor [2015] FCCA 2342 (27 August 2015)': '  Applications for the judicial review of decisions of refugee review tribunals must be made within 35 days of the date of the decision sought to be reviewed: s.477(1) of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth).  The court has power to extend the time if an application has been made in writing for that purpose and the Court is satisfied that it is necessary in the interests of the administration of justice to make the order: s.477(2)(b) of the Act. By this application, the applicant seeks an extension of the 35 day time limit so that he might commence an application for judicial review of a decision of a refugee review tribunal that was made on 6 January, 2015.  Any application for review by this court needed to be made by 10 February, 2015.  Using the filing date of the present application as the nominal filing date for his application for review (2 April, 2015), his proposed application for review is eight weeks out of time. Ordinarily, the time limits imposed by the rules of court ought to be observed.  Extensions of time are not granted simply for the asking.  The Court must be persuaded that occasion for the favourable exercise of the discretion arises on the facts of the case before it.  The discretion is to be exercised judicially and not arbitrarily or capriciously.  That requires the identification of the factors relevant in any particular case and the weighing of those factors to derive the outcome.  Ordinarily, the following matters are seen as relevant to the exercise of the discretion reposed in the Court by s.477(2) of the Act: the length of the delay; the explanation for the delay; the presence of prejudice to the respondent; and the merits of the substantive application. No other matters are present in the instant case that would add to that list. The first respondent does not suggest that there is any prejudice to him if the requested extension is granted.  Accordingly, only three out of the four matters identified above are relevant. I have already set out the length of the delay.  It is of about eight week’s duration. The applicant has filed an affidavit in which he sets out the explanation for his delay.  In that affidavit, filed on 2 April, 2015 the applicant deposes that he forgot to sign his name on his application to this Court.  His case manager only told him about the problem about one month after he lodged his application for filing.  Because it was not signed, the applicant’s suggestion seems to be that his application was rejected for filing and languished in the Registry.      However, there is nothing on the court file to indicate that he attempted to file his application any earlier than 2 April, 2015.  As the first respondent points out, even if this explained why the application was delayed by a month as the applicant claims, his application would still have been out of time by approximately a month.  No explanation has been offered for the remainder of the delay. Nonetheless, there is an explanation for some of the delay given by the applicant.  That there is some explanation weighs in favour of the extension he seeks. Perhaps a factor of more significance is whether the applicant’s proposed judicial review application has any prospects of success. In this regard, it is important to note that, at this point, I am not deciding the applicant’s judicial review application, but rather I am determining whether he has any prospect of success in the proposed application so as to inform the exercise of the discretion pursuant to s.477(2) of the Act.  Accordingly, I turn now to consider the merits of the applicant’s proposed application. To succeed in his application, the applicant must demonstrate that the tribunal’s decision is affected by jurisdictional error.  The applicant’s proposed grounds of appeal are:  I believe I’m satisfie the Article 1 of the Refugees Convention. That I well-found fear of being persecuted for reason of personal matters and the power of the Government  (errors in original) The tribunal’s decision followed upon a hearing that the tribunal invited the applicant to attend.  The hearing took place on 17 December, 2014.  The applicant and the tribunal were assisted by a mandarin interpreter.  Although the applicant was represented in respect of the tribunal proceeding, his representative did not attend the hearing. The tribunal gave its decision and the reasons for its decision on 6 January, 2015.  The tribunal accepted that the applicant is a citizen of the Peoples’ Republic of China.  He was granted a subclass 600 (visitor) visa on 4 December, 2013 and arrived in Australia on 16 December, 2013.  By 28 August, 2014 his visa had expired and he was located by the first respondent’s department and detained as an unlawful non-citizen under s.189 of the Act.  Soon after, on 5 September, 2014 the applicant lodged a valid application for a Protection (Class XA) visa. The tribunal recorded the claims made by the applicant when he made his visa application and then when he was interviewed by the first respondent’s delegate for the purposes of that application.  In particular, the applicant claimed: the authorities in China planned to construct factories in the applicant’s village and appropriated village land, including agricultural land belonging to the applicant’s family, for well below the market value. The authorities have not paid the villagers the small amount they were promised. The villagers resisted, and protested against the authorities’ plan. As a consequence, the applicant was detained and interrogated by the Chinese authorities. He experienced intimidation and threats. One of the applicant’s neighbours was pushed down some stairs by the authorities as a result of the protests, and died shortly afterwards. He needs the land as he has been a farmer all of his life and does not have skills to find another job in China. He attended school until junior high school in China and worked installing gyprock in Australia. If the applicant returns to China he will continue to protest. He fears being detained and interrogated if he tries to claim his right to his land. The applicant expanded his claims at the tribunal hearing.  He added a claim that he did not want to return to China because he had borrowed a lot of money from friends and family to come to Australia and, if he returned, they would ask for the money.   The tribunal expressed serious doubts about the applicant’s credibility and the plausibility of his claims.  The tribunal was not satisfied that the applicant was a credible witness and did not accept his evidence about the claimed acquisition of the village land for inadequate compensation, his involvement in ensuing protests and his short detention.  The tribunal gave detailed reasons for rejecting the applicant’s claims about those matters. As the first respondent records in his written submissions, the tribunal made the following observations regarding the applicant’s evidence: at [30]: The tribunal observes that the times and sequences given by the Applicant in his evidence at hearing are very confused and contradictory. The applicant gave no reasonable explanation for providing a confused account of the significant and relatively recent events. The tribunal finds his muddled narrative was not indicative of truth or genuine experiences.; at [31]: the tribunal found the applicant’s evidence regarding key incidents and details very vague, sometimes confused, and in some aspects implausible; at [34]: The applicant’s evidence regarding the number of villagers affected by the land confiscation made no sense. He stated that the total number of villagers affected, in both villages, was 200; yet the number of villagers affected in his village alone was ‘1000 villagers ...; at [35]: The applicant’s evidence in hearing about whether or not the factories were built on the confiscated land was confused and inconsistent; and at [44]: As set out above, the tribunal found the applicant’s evidence about the claimed acquisition of the village land for inadequate compensation, his involvement in ensuing protests and his short detention contradictory, vague and implausible or incoherent in significant aspects. The tribunal considers the applicant’s evidence unsatisfactory and it does not accept that any of the claimed events did occur. The tribunal does not find it credible that the applicant’s village land was taken by the town authorities, or that he was involved in any protests against such forced acquisition. It follows that the tribunal does not accept the applicant was briefly detained by police at such a protest. The tribunal accepted that the applicant owed money to his relatives and other villagers who helped finance his travel to Australia, but found that there was no evidence to suggest that he would experience harm from them if he returned to China and they demanded repayment. The tribunal found that there were no substantial grounds for believing that as a necessary and foreseeable consequence of the applicant being removed from Australia to China, there was a real risk that the applicant would suffer significant harm in terms of section 36(2)(aa) of the Act or that the applicant satisfied the criteria set out in section 36(2)(a) of the Act. In his oral submissions to me, the applicant cavilled with the findings made by the tribunal about the plausibility of his accounts.  His submissions were in line with the statement that appears as his proposed ground of review in his application.  His concern is not so much with the process of the tribunal – the way it went about its task or the way in which it made the findings that it did, but rather with the outcome of the process.   I am satisfied that the applicant’s proposed application seeks merits review rather than attempting to identify any jurisdictional error in the tribunal’s decision.  I have considered the tribunal’s reasons carefully, but cannot identify any error in the tribunal’s approach. No jurisdictional error is apparent in the tribunal’s reasons. Accordingly, in my view, the applicant’s proposed judicial review application has no prospects of success. Even though the applicant has provided something of an explanation of the delay of almost eight weeks in commencing this application, and notwithstanding that there is no demonstrable prejudice to the first respondent if leave is granted, given my view that the applicant has no prospects of success on the application for review that he wishes to pursue, I am not satisfied that is necessary in the interests of the administration of justice to grant the requested extension.   Accordingly, the application for an extension of time must be dismissed with costs.I certify that the preceding twenty-three (23) paragraphs are a true copy of the reasons for judgment of Judge Jarrett delivered on 27 August, 2015.Associate:  Date:  27 August 2015       ',\n",
       " 'AMU15 v Minister for Immigration & Anor [2015] FCCA 2312 (25 August 2015)': ' Ex tempore  This is an application pursuant to s.476(1) of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) for review of a decision of a refugee review tribunal given on 23 March 2015 that affirmed a decision of a delegate of the first respondent to refuse the applicant a Protection (Class XA) visa. The application was filed by the applicant without legal assistance.  It lacks any precision and arguably any proper grounds of review.   Directions were made on 19 May, 2015 to prepare the application for hearing.  Those directions provided the applicant with the opportunity to file any amended application, with full particulars of each ground of review and any affidavit evidence, by 9 July, 2015.  The applicant has not taken up that opportunity. The parties were both directed to file and serve written submissions prior to the hearing date.  The applicant has filed an affidavit that annexes what I will treat as his written submissions and some other documents.  The first respondent has also filed written submissions.  I have had regard to the written submissions filed by each party. Background  The applicant is an Indian citizen who arrived in Australia on 16 September, 2008 on a student visa.  The applicant’s student visa ceased on 1 March, 2011 and he lived in the community without a visa until he was taken into immigration detention on 27 July, 2014. On 2 September, 2014 the applicant applied for a Protection (class XA) visa.   In his visa application the applicant claimed to fear harm should he return to India on the basis that he is homosexual.  He claimed that he was raped when he was 8 years old by a male labourer and had been the subject of verbal, physical abuse, social exclusion and threats to his life since that incident.  The applicant claimed to fear verbal threats and threats of torture, hanging or stoning if he returned to his village.  He claimed that he could not report his problems to the Police because he would face jail, torture and perhaps death in jail.   He also claimed to have contracted hepatitis C from a sexual encounter with another man. The applicant’s claims were explored in an interview with a delegate of the first respondent.  On 21 January, 2015 his application was refused by a delegate of the first respondent.  The delegate did not accept that the applicant was homosexual. On 30 January, 2015 the applicant sought review of the delegate’s decision by a refugee review tribunal.  The tribunal was unable to make a favourable decision on the papers alone and so invited the applicant to attend a hearing before the tribunal to give evidence and present arguments. On 5 March, 2015 the applicant appeared by telephone before the tribunal.  He had the assistance of a Punjabi/English interpreter.  The tribunal further explored the applicant’s claims.  During that process, the applicant claimed that whilst in India, he had turned to drug use because he was “mentally weak, sick and depressed and wanted to get over that”.  It accepted a post hearing submission and attached materials concerning the treatment of homosexuals in India, in Islam and in other countries from the applicant.  On 23 March 2015 the tribunal affirmed the delegate’s decision.  The tribunal identified the central issue as whether it accepted the applicant’s claim that he is a homosexual.  The tribunal accepted the applicant’s claim to have been sexually assaulted at a young age, but considered that this assault was not an incident of the applicant’s claimed homosexuality and did not result in the applicant suffering serious or significant harm from verbal, physical and social exclusion. The tribunal identified a number of inconsistencies in the applicant’s evidence that undermined the applicant’s claimed fear of harm due to his homosexuality. The tribunal considered that the applicant’s inability to identify any serious or significant harm he had suffered in India because of his claimed homosexual activities between the age of 16 or 17 and 24 was inconsistent with his claimed fear of harm.  The tribunal considered the applicant’s evidence that he took drugs in India up to the time he left for Australia to be fabricated. The tribunal considered the applicant’s claim that he contracted hepatitis C because of his homosexual activities but considered that the evidence did not support a claim that homosexual relations is the only cause of hepatitis C.   The tribunal discussed inconsistencies in, and implausible elements of, the applicant’s claimed history of homosexual activity in Australia.  The tribunal then found that the applicant’s claims to have participated in homosexual activity in Australia or in India were not credible, that the applicant is not and has not been a homosexual.  Further, it found that he would not be forced to marry if returned to India. The tribunal found that the applicant’s history of education and living in India was inconsistent with his claimed fear of harm and that his delay in applying for protection reinforced the tribunal’s finding that his claims were not genuine. The tribunal found that the applicant did not satisfy s.36(2)(a) or s.36(2)(aa) of the Act. Grounds of review  The application lists the following grounds:  (1) Decision made with lack of information on my claim for protection.  (2) Decision is not based on law.  (3) R.R.T has misused the power of making decision on my claim  (4) Decision was made without any information about me, my past life, my situation back in my Country about my problems and fears  (5) Decision was against the Migration and Refugee acts.  (6) Decision was so irresponsible  (7) R.R.T has violated my rights as refugee The first respondent’s submissions suggest that grounds 3 and 6 can be dealt with together.  It is argued that they each seek impermissible merits review.  I agree.  The tribunal is empowered by the Act to hear and determine the applicant’s review applicant.  That is what it did. It did so according to the requirements of the rules of procedural fairness set out in the Act.  I can see no basis upon which it might be sensibly suggested that the tribunal misused its power to make a decision on the applicant’s claims.  Ground 6 is commentary upon the tribunal’s decision and is not a ground of review at all.  To the extent that it invites a consideration of the merits of the tribunal’s decision, it seeks that I embark upon a course not available to the Court. The first respondent suggests that grounds 1 and 4 might be best viewed as an allegation that the tribunal failed to take into account relevant information.  I agree with that suggestion.  And in this regard, it is important to note that it was the applicant that chose what information to place before the tribunal and the extent to which he would inform the tribunal of the background to his claims.  His claims about drug use are a good example.  Whilst he accepted that he had not raised that matter in his visa application or with the delegate, his response to the tribunal when asked why he had not raised it was simply that he had not been asked.  The tribunal’s reasons, however, do not suggest that the applicant was asked about drug use, rather, he volunteered the information when answering a more general charge by the tribunal member that the applicant had not suffered serious or significant harm in India because of his claimed homosexuality.  Further, to the extent that the applicant’s grounds 1 and 4 are meant to suggest that the tribunal did not give proper consideration to the material provided by the applicant in his post hearing submission, the reasons reveal that the tribunal’s acknowledged the material supplied to it by the applicant.  However, the weight that the tribunal gave to that information was a matter for the tribunal as part of its fact finding function.  Further, as the first respondent points out, given the tribunal’s rejection of the applicant’s claimed homosexuality and homosexual activity, the tribunal was not obliged to address the material concerning the treatment of homosexuals in India, in Islam and in other countries that the applicant had provided. The remaining grounds have no substance.  No error of law or failure to comply with the relevant legislation is apparent from the tribunal’s reasons for decision.  No lack of procedural fairness is evident. Conclusion  The tribunal’s decision is not affected by jurisdictional error.  The tribunal’s decision is a privative clause decision and is unable to be challenged in this Court. The application must be dismissed with costs.I certify that the preceding twenty-three (23) paragraphs are a true copy of the reasons for judgment of Judge JarrettAssociate:  Date:   1 September 2015       ',\n",
       " 'AND15 v Minister for Immigration & Anor [2015] FCCA 2063 (31 July 2015)': \"  This is an application for a Constitutional writ within the Court’s jurisdiction under s.476 of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) in respect of a decision of the Tribunal made on 13 March 2015 affirming a decision not to grant the applicant a protection visa.  Although the application seeks an order under s.477, the application was filed within time and identifies the following grounds:    1. The Tribunal error by no taking into account the applicant evidence properly that he is a Shia Muslim and belongs to TURI family which is the centre of target killing and serious discrimination in Pakistani Tribal areas.  PARTICULARS  Paragraph no 10 and 11 of the subject RRT decision.2. The Tribunal error by not putting relevant Country Report for his comments and denied National Justice.   PARTICULRAS  Paragraph no 15 of the subject decision of the RRT.  3. The Tribunal error by considering the applicant's relocation issue incorrectly.  PARTICULARSThe tribunal failed to consider that my look, language and ethnicity will put his life into serious danger. The applicant is not educated enough and not trained to obtain any reasonable job to survive in other location.  The Court made orders on 28 May 2015 providing an opportunity for the applicant to amend the application or file any further affidavit evidence and submissions.  No such documents were filed by the applicant. At the commencement of the hearing the applicant indicated that his son had recently gone missing and that the Taliban had recently threatened his family.  The applicant also said that he is not safe over there and that he wants to continue his life and he does not want to die.  The Court explained that this Court did not have jurisdiction to revisit the merits of the matter and was not in a position to make fresh findings of fact in relation to the applicant’s fears of persecution.  The Court explained that the jurisdiction was confined to determining whether the Tribunal had conducted the review according to law and could not make fresh findings of fact about the applicant’s fears. The applicant was found to be a citizen of Pakistan, and his claim for protection was assessed against that country.  The applicant appeared before the Tribunal on 27 February 2015 to give evidence and present arguments and was assisted by an interpreter as well as being represented by his registered migration agent.  The Tribunal accepted that the applicant was a member of the [X] tribe and accepted that the applicant’s identity documents identified him by name, tribe and place of origin in such a way as to cause him to be identified throughout Pakistan as a Shia Muslim of the [X] tribe from a particular location. The Tribunal carefully identified the applicant’s fears of harm and his experiences in a particular location.  It was a result of that evidence that the Tribunal accepted that the applicant, as a [X] Shia from a particular location, there was a real chance that he would face serious harm for reasons of his Shiite religion and his [X] ethnicity now or in the reasonably foreseeable future if he returns to the particular location.  The Tribunal found that the applicant faces a real chance of persecution for reasons of his Shiite religion and his [X] ethnicity if he returns to a particular location now or in the reasonably foreseeable future. It was in those circumstances that the Tribunal turned to consider the issue of relocation.  The Tribunal carefully addressed the two steps consistent with the decision in SZATV v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship  (2007) 23 CLR 18 by considering whether the applicant could move to a place within Pakistan where he does not have a well-founded fear of persecution and, secondly, if he could so move, whether it would be reasonable in the sense of practicable for the applicant to do so. It is clear that in assessing the issue of relocation the Tribunal took into account both the applicant’s Shiite religion and his [X] ethnicity.  The Tribunal found that it did not accept there to be a real chance that the applicant will be targeted for harm for the separate or cumulative reasons of his Shiite religion or his [X] ethnicity, his imputed political opinion or his membership of particular social group or any convention reason if he returned to two specified locations now or in the reasonable foreseeable future.   The Tribunal proceeded to consider the issue of whether it was reasonably practical for the applicant in the circumstances to relocate to those two specific locations and, relevantly, found that relocation to the two places is reasonably practical in the particular circumstances of the applicant and, accordingly, the Tribunal was satisfied that the applicant is not a person in respect of whom Australia has protection obligations under the Refugee Convention.  As a result of the findings in relation to relocation, the Tribunal did not accept that there was a real chance that the applicant will suffer significant harm as a necessary and foreseeable consequence of being removed from Australia to Pakistan. It was in those circumstances the Tribunal concluded that the applicant did not satisfy the criteria under s.36(2)(a) or s.36(2)(aa) and was not a person in respect of whom Australia had a protection obligation.  In relation to ground 1, I accept the first respondent’s submissions that it is clear that the Tribunal did take into account the applicant being a Shia Muslim belonging to the [X] family, and it was by reason of taking those matters into account that the Tribunal made the findings referred to above, and I accept the first respondent’s submission that there is no substance in relation to ground 1 of the application. In relation to ground 2, country information falls within an exception under s.424A(3)(a) regardless of whether the alleged information might otherwise have fallen within s.424A.  There is no substance in relation to ground 2.  In relation to ground 3, the Tribunal correctly applied the two stage test identified above, and there is no substance in the contention that the Tribunal erred by incorrectly considering the issue of relocation.  I also accept the first respondent’s submission that the Tribunal did not assess the risk of harm in the two specified places for relocation solely on the basis of the number of Shias living in Pakistan. I also accept the first respondent’s submission that there was no failure by the Tribunal to take into account the applicant’s employment, experience, skills, language and family connections.  I further accept the first respondent’s submission that there was no irrelevant consideration taken into account in applying the second limb of the test identified in SZATV v The Minister for Immigration and Citizenship supra.  Accordingly, there is no jurisdictional error of a kind identified in ground 3 of the application.  The application is dismissed.I certify that the preceding eleven (11) paragraphs are a true copy of the reasons for judgment of Judge StreetAssociate:  Date: 5 August 2015       \",\n",
       " 'ARD15 v Minister for Immigration & Anor [2015] FCCA 2180 (12 August 2015)': \"  This is an application for a Constitutional writ within the Court’s jurisdiction under s.476 of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) in respect to a decision of the Tribunal made on 8 April 2015 affirming a decision by the delegate not to grant the applicant a protection (class XA) visa.  The applicant was found to be a citizen of Sri Lanka and his claims were assessed against that country.  The applicant appeared before the Tribunal on 31 March 2015 to give evidence and present arguments which was conducted with the assistance of an interpreter and the applicant was represented by a registered migration agent. The grounds of the application are as follows:  1. The Refugee Review Tribunal erred in finding that the tribunal is not satisfied that there is a real risk the applicant will suffer significant harm. The decision is bias and unreasonable.  Particulars  (a) Error in finding that the applicant has not been subjected to discrimination or harm   b) Error in finding that the applicant does not have substantial grounds for believing that there is a real risk will suffer significant harm if returned to Sri Lanka. On 11 June 2015, this Court made orders providing an opportunity for the applicant to file an amended application, any further affidavit evidence and submissions.  No documents were filed by the applicant and at the commencement of the hearing, the applicant indicated that he had not been able to obtain funds to obtain a lawyer to seek legal assistance and he urged the Court to grant him more time in relation to his application.  The application for an adjournment was opposed. There was nothing said by the applicant to indicate that there was any utility in granting an adjournment or that there was any reason to believe that the provision of further time would give rise to the applicant being in a position to have legal representation.  Further, this is a matter that was fixed for hearing on 11 June 2015 and no steps have been taken in accordance with those directions or any explanation advanced beyond the applicant’s lack of financial means to identify steps taken to obtain legal assistance. In these circumstances, there are insufficient grounds to support the grant of an adjournment.  Further, I am satisfied that there would be no utility in granting an adjournment as the application is, for the reasons identified in this decision, doomed to failure.   The applicant identified his political involvement in relation to his fear of returning to Sri Lanka and his belief that he would suffer harm if he was returned to Sri Lanka.  The applicant’s political role was clearly identified and addressed by the Tribunal. I accept the first respondent’s submission that what was raised by the applicant orally were matters going to the merits of the application for review which were matters for the Tribunal to decide and do not disclose any jurisdictional error.  Insofar as the application asserts that the Tribunal erred in finding that it was not satisfied that there was a real risk that the applicant would suffer significant harm, this was an adverse finding of fact that was open on the material before the Tribunal. Insofar as the application advances the proposition that the decision was affected by bias, I accept the first respondent’s submission that bias has to be clearly alleged and properly proved and that the applicant has failed to prove that allegation.  Further, there is no conduct identified, other than the adverse findings by the Tribunal, in relation to the allegation of bias and that is not a basis upon which bias can be made out. Further, I accept the first respondent’s submission that the adverse findings by the Tribunal are not a basis upon which a reasonable observer might reasonably apprehend that the Tribunal might not bring an independent and impartial mind to the determination of the matter on its merits.  The allegation of bias is not made out.  Insofar as the application asserts that the adverse findings were unreasonable, the Tribunal gave reasons for dealing with the applicant’s claims and those adverse findings cannot be said to lack an evident and intelligible justification. To the extent that the grounds in the application sought to cavil with the adverse findings of the Tribunal, I accept the first respondent’s submission that the adverse findings of fact were open on the material before the Tribunal and have a logical foundation. The application fails to disclose any jurisdictional error.  The first respondent also drew attention to the allegation in the affidavit filed in support of the application that the Tribunal had failed to consider relevant material relating to the applicant’s political party involvement, his personal circumstances and alleged discrimination. The first respondent submitted that it was clear from the Tribunal’s reasons, and in particular at paras.33 and 43, that the applicant’s personal circumstances, including political involvement, were addressed as well as the applicant’s fears of discrimination.  I also accept the first respondent’s submission that it is clear that the Tribunal intellectually engaged with the application of the PAM3 Refugee and Humanitarian Guidelines in light of the reference to those guidelines in para.19 and the analysis of the conditions which the applicant would face, identified in para.85 of the Tribunal’s reasons. The applicant was found to be a citizen of Sri Lanka and his claims were assessed against that country and relevantly, the Tribunal found:  33. The Tribunal asked if the applicant had ever been threatened or harmed because of his involvement with the JVP. The applicant stated he had not been. The Tribunal asked if the applicant feared harm because of his involvement with the JVP. The applicant said no.   34. The Tribunal accepts that the applicant was involved with the JVP, as a member and a candidate for local elections. The Tribunal does not consider that the applicant faced any difficulties arising from his involvement with the JVP, including while going north on some occasion to see what was happening. The Tribunal finds that the applicant has never been threatened or harmed arising out of his family’s involvement with the JVP, and the death of an uncle in the 1970s is not a reason for the applicant to fear being harmed now or in the reasonably foreseeable future.  35. The Tribunal finds that the applicant does not have a real chance of serious harm arising from his involvement with the JVP, now or in the reasonably foreseeable future. The Tribunal finds that the applicant does not have a well-founded fear of persecution arising from his involvement with the JVP.  ...  40. Asked directly by the Tribunal, the applicant could not recall any slogans or pictures on the posters. The Tribunal noted the report that the applicant had provided stated specifically that:   A ‘Party for Us’ announced the new party in a poster and social media campaign in the weeks leading up the Convention, showcasing images of the poor and exploited – of different classes, occupations and ethnicities, who are unrepresented in the present political system.  ...  43. The Tribunal asked if the applicant had ever personally been threatened, attacked or harmed because of his involvement with [P]. The applicant stated he had not been. The Tribunal has placed some weight on this admission.  ...  45. While the Tribunal accepts that there is the opportunity to draw new information through the interview, hearing and submission writing process, or provide greater depth and detail about particular claims, the Tribunal is extremely concerned by the absence of this information about threats to his family in the original statement of the applicant. The applicant has not provided information about what he claims to be the most recent event that has affected him or his family, either the stoning or the phone calls. He has raised issues of his uncle and friends of his father, who had difficulties in the 1970s. The Tribunal considers that incidents such as threatening telephone calls, or stones thrown at a house, where no other act of violence has taken place in the applicant’s lifetime, would be recalled and referenced by the applicant in the first instance, they would not be overlooked in the preparation of his statement. As claimed by the applicant, this is the only threatening act that had ever occurred to him and his immediate family. While the applicant has stated his memory is not that good, the Tribunal does not accept that the only actual act of violence that has occurred to the applicant’s family would be forgotten or left out by the applicant, to be detailed at a later date, or was so common as to not warrant mention in his statement. The Tribunal considers that the absence of this information is because it did not occur, and the applicant has raised it at a later stage to provide some limited information about there being a threat to him or his family. The Tribunal does not accept that this stoning event or threatening phone calls occurred.  ...  49. The Tribunal does not accept that the applicant, involved with a minor party that is [P] in his home village, will be harmed because of his involvement with [P]. His past involvement with politics is instructive, he has been involved in electoral campaigns in his local area for the JVP, a like-minded left wing minor political party in 2006 and 2011, and he did not have any difficulty or issue arising from such involvement. This included claiming to represent the people who did not have a voice, and raising issues of corruption in the political elite. He was not harmed for these activities, and given that the Tribunal has not accepted that in 2012 the applicant’s family had any difficulties in Sri Lanka, his family has not suffered because of his political involvement. The Tribunal does not accept that simply because he supports a minor political party in his village, that is not the UNP or the UPFA, he will be harmed. The Tribunal does not accept that members or supporters of larger parties would be concerned with the activities of the applicant in support of his party, given the very limited support it has in the area, as taken from the most recent Council and Provincial elections. The Tribunal does not accept that the applicant would be targeted because of his political activities in his home area.  ...  51. The Tribunal asked the applicant if there would be any difficulties arising from his leaving the JVP to join [P]. The applicant stated he had no fears from the JVP. Later in the hearing he stated that he had broken his promise to the party by leaving. The Tribunal asked if he would face any harm because of leaving the JVP. The applicant said he would not. The Tribunal finds that the applicant does not have a real chance of serious harm or a real risk of significant harm arising from his leaving the JVP and joining the FSP.   52. The Tribunal does not accept that the applicant, on return to Sri Lanka, and involving himself in further political activities, would face any difficulty arising from these activities. Again, the Tribunal notes that the applicant has been able to be politically active without incident during times when he states there was significant concerns for individuals opposing the political system, and the Tribunal does not accept that the applicant would be harmed in the present political system for his political beliefs. The Tribunal does not accept that the applicant, a minor politically active individual, from a very minor political party, would be targeted for harm in Sri Lanka, now or in the reasonably foreseeable future.  ...  54. The Tribunal considers that this submission is highly speculative and not a prospect of harm that the applicant actually faces. The applicant resided in Sri Lanka and was involved in politics in a limited manner, including supporting parties that raised the issue of corruption in the political elite or the authorities generally. He was not approached or targeted by anyone because of his involvement with these political parties. The Tribunal considers that the prospect of the applicant being targeted in the future for this reason is remote, and one that cannot be described as a real chance of occurring.  55. The Tribunal finds that the applicant does not have a real chance of serious harm arising from his involvement with [P], now or in the reasonably foreseeable future. The Tribunal finds that the applicant does not have a well-founded fear of persecution for this reason.  56. The Tribunal finds that the applicant does not have a real chance of serious harm arising fromhis political opinion. The Tribunal finds that the applicant does not have a well-founded fear of persecution for this Contention reason, now or in the reasonably foreseeable future.  57. Further, based on the findings on the evidence before it as detailed above, and having determined that the applicant does not face a real chance of the applicant being harmed for this reason, the Tribunal further finds that the applicant does not face a real risk of significant harm for this reason.  ...  64. ...The Tribunal does not accept that the applicant will be harmed on return through the airport because he has been politically active in the past for minor political parties. The Tribunal finds that the applicant is not wanted by the Sri Lankan authorities and will not be subjected to any detention or interrogation on arrival to Sri Lanka other than the standard questioning and procedures described by DFAT. The Tribunal finds that the applicant will not be harmed during the questioning process at the airport on return to Sri Lanka.   65. The Tribunal accepts the Sri Lankan authorities will assume the applicant has sought asylum in Australia, having regard to his unlawful departure by boat and the context and circumstances in which he would likely be returned. The Tribunal does not accept, given the confidentiality of the process, that his individual claims will be known. Having regard to the evidence and country information before it, the Tribunal does not accept the authorities will be concerned by the applicant's imputed asylum claim such that there is any real chance any state-actor will be motivated to harm him at any stage of the re-entry and return process, or the charge, remand and bail process, or in the process of imposing legal penalties for his illegal departure, for this reason because of his residence in a western country, seeking asylum in a Western country, either individually or cumulatively.  ...  67. The Tribunal is not willing to extrapolate from these reports a real chance of such harm to the applicant as a minor Sinhalese political activist (and/or) failed asylum seeker, having regard to his circumstances. The Tribunal does not accept that the weight of the evidence before it supports the view that there is any real chance the government will detain, harm, torture or kill the applicant personally due to any assumption that he has criticised the government in the course of seeking asylum, or otherwise arising for seeking asylum. For reasons outlined elsewhere above, the Tribunal has found there is no real chance the applicant, in his circumstances, will be harmed because of his previous political activity for the JVP or FSP.  68. ...Having regard to the cumulative accepted evidence, the Tribunal does not accept the applicant will be of adverse interest to the authorities on return to his home area. The Tribunal does not accept the applicant’s submission that the authorities would wait a period of time before seeking to harm him; the Tribunal does not accept that there is any reason for the authorities to want to harm him.   69. Were the applicant to be questioned or monitored briefly at the airport or in his home region by the authorities due to his illegal departure, the Tribunal does not accept this itself amounts to harm or serious harm to him. The Tribunal does not accept that the applicant would be of ongoing or recurrent interest, or that he would face a real chance of serious harm in this context. The Tribunal does not find the weight of evidence before it supports that view.   70. The Tribunal has considered country information provided, including from Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, which indicates that they (and other credible global rights groups) are monitoring and assessing the situation of returnee failed asylum seekers to Sri Lanka, and the Tribunal does not accept that reporting as suggesting more than isolated and profile-specific instances of detention, torture or harm to returnees.  71. For these reasons the Tribunal finds the applicant faces no real chance of serious harm as a returning failed asylum seeker from Australia (or the West or overseas) - regardless of whether seeking asylum is conceived of either as an imputed political opinion, or as an identifying characteristic of any particular social group, in any combination with other characteristics of being a man of adverse political opinion or illegal departure.  72. Having determined that the applicant does not face a real chance of the applicant being harmed for this reason, the Tribunal further finds that the applicant does not face a real risk of significant harm for this reason.  ...  81. The Tribunal finds the chances very remote that the applicant will be sentenced to any term of imprisonment due to his illegal departure. The Tribunal accepts that the applicant will face a financial penalty as prescribed under the Act. The Tribunal considers that the applicant will be able to pay the lawful financial penalty imposed for his illegal departure. The Tribunal finds that the applicant would pay any financial penalty imposed under Sri Lankan law for his illegal departure, or therefore, that there is any real chance or real risk he will face serious or significant harm in the reasonably foreseeable future deriving from any legal penalty being imposed.  ...  85. ...The Tribunal finds that the applicant does not face a real risk of significant harm while detained on remand.  86. In these circumstances, the Tribunal finds the applicant faces no real chance of serious harm now or in the reasonably foreseeable future due to his illegal departure, taken alone or in combination with his other circumstances.  ...  88. Having regard to all the circumstances and findings above, both individually and cumulatively, the Tribunal finds that the applicant does not face a real chance of serious harm in Sri Lanka arising from his political opinion, or as a member of a particular social group of either failed asylum seekers or returnees from a Western country or persons who left Sri Lanka illegally.  89. The Tribunal further finds that the applicant’s political opinion and involvement, his status as a failed asylum seeker or a returnee who may be charged with improperly departing Sri Lanka, does not give rise to substantial grounds for believing that there is a real risk he will suffer significant harm upon being removed from Australia to Sri Lanka.  90. Having regard to all the circumstances and findings above, both individually and cumulatively, the Tribunal finds that the applicant does not face a real chance of serious harm in Sri Lanka for a Convention based reason, now or in the reasonably foreseeable future. The Tribunal finds that the applicant does not have a well-founded fear of persecution for a Convention based reason.  91. Having regard to all the circumstances and findings above, both individually and cumulatively, the Tribunal finds that the applicant does not have substantial grounds for believing that there is a real risk he will suffer significant harm upon being removed from Australia to Sri Lanka. It was in these circumstances the Tribunal concluded the applicant did not satisfy their criterion under s.36(2)(a) or s.36(2)(aa) and that the applicant was not a person to whom Australia owed the protection obligation.  The adverse findings by the Tribunal were open and the application fails to disclose any jurisdictional error.  The application is dismissed.I certify that the preceding thirteen (13) paragraphs are a true copy of the reasons for judgment of Judge StreetAssociate:  Date: 19 August 2015       \",\n",
       " 'ASB15 v Minister for Immigration & Anor [2015] FCCA 2227 (17 August 2015)': \"  This is an application within the Court’s jurisdiction under s.476 of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) for a Constitutional writ in respect of a decision the Tribunal made on 16 April 2015, affirming a decision of the delegate not to grant the applicant a protection (class XA) visa.  The applicant arrived in Australia on a visitor visa on 1 November 2013, which was granted on 16 July 2013 and it was not until 23 January 2014 that the applicant lodged an application for protection.  The applicant was found to be a citizen of China and her claims were assessed against that country.   The applicant had lived in Tokyo for almost two years and then returned to China in 2010.  The applicant’s claims to fear of persecution were founded on her Catholic faith and her fear by reason of incidents that she alleged had occurred as a result of attending underground church activities.  The Tribunal sent the applicant an invitation to appear at the hearing by letter dated 13 March 2015, in compliance with the statutory requirements.  The applicant appeared before the Tribunal on 14 April 2015 to give evidence and present arguments and was assisted by an interpreter as well as giving part of the evidence and arguments in English. At the time the applicant applied for protection the applicant identified her language as Mandarin and did not identify any dialect.  The same position occurred in relation to the application for review and at the time of the hearing before the Tribunal, again it was noted that the applicant had the benefit of an interpreter that could speak Mandarin.  At no stage did the applicant seek to identify that there was any problem with the interpretation at the time of the hearing before the Tribunal.   No evidence has been put before this Court of any inaccuracies in the interpretation at the time of the review hearing and no explanation has been given as to why it is that there is alleged to be some problem with the interpreter because of a lack of familiarity with the Tianjin dialect, other than the assertion from the bar table that a friend from the applicant’s church has told her so.  The original application identified grounds relating to a Falun Gong practitioner, which I accept, on the affidavit evidence of the applicant, was an error by the lawyer assisting the applicant. The applicant filed an affidavit on 1 July 2015, which raised the following two grounds:1. I think the RRT officer did not consider the risk that my safety will be threatened if return to China. Moreover, she did not consider that Chinese government is sensitive with underground church activities in China. The underground Catholic will be persecuted by the government.   I think the officer did not consider these facts because she has a prejudice against me. Therefore, I request judge let RRT reconsider their decision. In relation to the first ground, it is clear that the Tribunal carefully addressed the applicant’s claim of fear in relation to her church activities and as a Catholic, a member of the underground church and that the Tribunal had difficulty with the applicant’s credit and rejected her claims in this regard.  There is no substance in relation to ground 1 identified in the affidavit of 1 July 2015.  Ground 2 makes a general allegation of bias.   A similar generalised allegation was made orally.  No conduct was identified by reason of which a fair-minded observer might apprehend that the Tribunal might not bring an independent and impartial mind to the determination of the matter on its merits.  Bias must be clearly alleged and distinctly proved.  No bias has been proved in the present case.  In relation to the grounds identified in the application first filed, the applicant sought leave to file an amended application which deleted grounds 1 to 4.   To the extent that the grounds 1 to 4 should have referred to the applicant’s practice of the Catholic faith, I should note that there was no substance in any of those deleted grounds, even if construed in that fashion.  The amended grounds are as follows:  1. 1 I am keen to self-improvement in bible stud and the religious knowledge but the level of Catholicism knowledge is not the measurements for an individual's depth of faith, and whether the individual have committed and have made contributions to the Church.  2 The Tribunal should have considered my background and the culture difference between my home country China and Australia. I exhibited understanding of aspects of Catholicism/Christianity when asked by the delegate and the RRT. My knowledge was consistent with my claimed involvement and commitment for several years. The underground church in China may use dialect or specific words which used locally during the meeting. Thus, my answers about the Catholicism asked by the RRT might be inaccurately interpreted during the hearing, since the RRT did not offer an interpreter who was familiar with Tianjin Dialect I speaking.  3 The Refugee Review Tribunal (RRT) unfairly ignored my well-founded fear of persecution in China. As stated in my statement, I am an underground Catholic. During the interview and the hearing, I evidenced my experience of persecution due to participate in underground church meetings. According to Amnesty International's 2014 report, although the Chinese authorities have shown an increasing tolerance for unofficial religious activities that do not challenge the authority of the state. the tolerance varies according to the location. Tianjin is one of the most highly controlled city in China. The persecution includes re-education, and a variety of extralegal coercive measures such as arbitrary arrests, forced labor, and physical torture sometimes resulting in death. These information was ignored by the RRT. (Please see attached evidences)  4 The Tribunal made the conclusion that I had to travel to Japan to seek employment and my sole motivation for attending Church was to strengthen my protection claims based on no reasons. It was very unfair for me. Moreover, the Tribunal should have considered my background and the culture difference between my home country China and Australia. I exhibited understanding of aspects of Catholicism/Christianity when asked by the delegate and the RRT. My knowledge was consistent with my claimed involvement and commitment for several years. The underground church in China may use dialect or specific words which used locally during the meeting. Thus, my answers about the Catholicism asked by the RRT might be inaccurately interpreted during the hearing, since the RRT did not offer an interpreter who was familiar with Tianjin Dialect I speaking. In relation to ground 1 of the amended grounds, I accept the first respondent’s submission that it is clear that the Tribunal, whilst referring to the applicant’s level of knowledge of Catholicism, did not embark upon the role of an arbiter of doctrine of the kind that would be impermissible as identified in WALT v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2007] FCAFC 2 but rather that the Tribunal merely explored the applicant’s knowledge and understanding and her alleged commitment. It is clear that there were other inconsistencies in the applicant’s evidence that gave rise to the Tribunal finding that the applicant was not a truthful witness and those inconsistencies were carefully summarised at paras.17 to 21.  There is no substance in relation to ground 1 of the amended grounds.   In relation to ground 2 of the amended application, it is clear that the Tribunal did take into account the region from which the applicant came and this was squarely identified in the delegate’s decision and was clearly picked up by the Tribunal.   Insofar as ground 2 asserts a difficulty with the interpretation and alleges inaccuracies, no such difficulty with the interpretation has been proved.  I do not accept the assertion by the applicant that there was any inaccuracy in the translation and no evidence had been put on by the applicant to support that assertion beyond what was said from the bar table about assertions b friend from the church.  Ground 2 fails to make out any jurisdictional error.  In relation to ground 3, it is clear that the Tribunal properly evaluated whether the applicant had a well-founded fear of persecution. The grounds of the claims advanced included, in addition to a Catholic belief, fear of harm from the applicant’s husband, which was also the subject of adverse findings by the Tribunal.  Those adverse findings were clearly open on the material before the Tribunal.  Those findings cannot be said to lack an evident and intelligible justification.  It was a matter for the Tribunal to determine what weight it gave to country information and ground 3 appears to be an impermissible challenge to the merits of the matter. Ground 3 fails to make out any jurisdictional error.  In relation to ground 4, it was clearly relevant that the applicant had returned from Japan to China, in relation to the allegations of fear or persecution in China.   It was a matter for the Tribunal to weigh the significance of the applicant returning from Japan to China and there is no jurisdictional error by reason of that matter being taken into account by the Tribunal. Nor is it the case that the Tribunal failed to take into account the applicant’s background and her claims and evidence.  It is also clear that the Tribunal took into account the applicant’s alleged involvement in the church and made adverse findings of credit that were open in material before the Tribunal.   To the extent that the ground 4 alleges inaccuracy in the interpretation of the evidence given by the applicant, it has not been proved by the applicant that there was any inaccuracy.  Ground 4 fails to identify any jurisdictional error.  For the reasons given, the amended application and the interim application, including the grounds in the affidavit dated 1 July 2015, all fail to identify any jurisdictional error.  Nothing said by the applicant from the bar table advanced any ground beyond the matters addressed above and for the reasons given, nothing said by the applicant identifies any jurisdictional error.  The amended application is dismissed.I certify that the preceding fifteen (15) paragraphs are a true copy of the reasons for judgment of Judge StreetAssociate:  Date: 20 August 2015       \",\n",
       " 'ATW15 v Minister for Immigration & Border Protection & Anor [2015] FCCA 1830 (2 July 2015)': \"  On 18 May 2015, the applicant filed an application seeking judicial review of a decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal, dated 5 May 2015 and handed down on 6 May 2015 (“the RRT”).  On 25 June 2015, the applicant attended a directions hearing before me. I explained to the applicant that the role of this Court is very different to that of the RRT and that it was not for this Court to reconsider his claims and make different factual findings or reach different conclusions to the RRT.  I also explained to the applicant that at present, the grounds of his application did not identify any error capable of review by this Court. I further explained to the applicant that, under the Rules of this Court, where the application does not disclose an arguable case for the relief sought, the application may be dismissed forthwith. At the directions hearing, the applicant was provided with a copy of the applicable costs schedule of the Court and I explained to the applicant the consequences that would flow to him if a costs order was made against him. Namely, that whilst any costs order remains unpaid, it becomes a debt to the Commonwealth of Australia. As such, the applicant’s ability to obtain any other type of visa or re-enter Australia may be significantly affected.  The applicant confirmed he wished to continue with his application for judicial review of the RRT’s decision. The applicant was given leave to file and serve an Amended Application giving complete particulars of each ground of review relied upon, together with any further evidence by way of affidavit, by 29 June 2015. The applicant was also directed to file and serve written submissions in support of the grounds of his application by 29 June 2015. At the directions hearing, the applicant was provided with the contact details of legal services providers and interpreting and translation services in documents headed in his own language. The matter was listed for today for a hearing pursuant to r.44.12 of the Federal Circuit Court Rules 2001 (Cth) (“the Rules”), a copy of which was also given to the applicant, together with a copy of the costs schedule of the Court. Rule 44.12 of the Rules provides as follows:  “(1)  At a hearing of an application for an order to show cause, the Court may:  (a)  if it is not satisfied that the application has raised an arguable case for the relief claimed—dismiss the application; or  (b)  if it is satisfied that the application has raised an arguable case for the relief claimed—adjourn the proceeding and order a respondent to show cause at a final hearing why an order for the relief claimed should not be made on such of the grounds mentioned in the application as are specified by the Court; or  (c)  without making an order under paragraph (b), make final orders in relation to the claims for relief and grounds mentioned in the application.  (2)  To avoid doubt, a dismissal under paragraph (1)(a) is interlocutory.” Relevantly, r.44.13 provides:  “(1)  At a hearing of an application for an order to show cause, the applicant is confined to the relief sought and the grounds mentioned in the application.” On 29 June 2015, the applicant filed an Amended Application, prepared by the applicant's solicitor, Mr Newman, who represented the applicant before the Court this morning.  Mr Newman consented to the matter proceeding this morning pursuant to r.44.12 of the Rules.  Mr Newman acknowledged that no submissions had been filed by the applicant but that he was in a position to make oral submissions before the Court this morning in support of the Amended Application, on which he relied. The ground of review detailed in the applicant’s Amended Application, filed on 29 June 2015, is as follows:  “1. The Tribunal accepted the claim by the protection visa applicant that upon his return to Sri Lanka - as an illegal departee - he would be subject to the imposition of a fine of 50,000 rupees, approximating 2/3rds of the average yearly wage but, nevertheless, found the law to be non-discriminatory and in that way non-persecutory.  In doing so, the Tribunal erred in law and in fact when it failed to consider that notwithstanding, the law's application was confined to a social class, namely those who placed no faith in the government's protection and who chose to leave clandestinely.  Moreover, the Tribunal failed to consider what were the prospects of the applicant's family being able to assist the applicant in paying the fine, failing which a period of imprisonment was probable.” The first respondent, in written submissions filed on 1 July 2015, accurately summarised the background of the applicant’s claims and the RRT’s decision, as follows:  “Background The applicant is a male citizen of Sri Lanka born on 23 November 1984. The applicant arrived as an illegal maritime arrival on 10 August 2012.  The applicant applied for a Protection (Class XA) visa on 26 March 2013. His claims were set out in a statutory declaration accompanying the application  which claimed, in summary:  4.1 The applicant claimed to fear harm from Criminal Investigation Department (CID)  and opposition supporters because of his support for the Tamil National Alliance (TNA) and work excavating areas which had human remains.   4.2 The applicant claimed that in 1995 he and other family members sustained injuries during an air attack by government troops.   4.3 The applicant claimed that he was rounded up and detained by the CID, army and police for a day in 2001 and 2003 and accused of being a member of the LTTE.    4.4 The applicant claimed he was detained, beaten and interrogated for 9 days in June 2006 by the Karuna group. The applicant claimed he was accused of being a member of the LTTE and was only released after his mother paid a bribe.   4.5 The applicant claimed to fear harm from the CID due to his work excavating and clearing mines in the north.  He claimed that the CID would suspect he would disclose the atrocities he saw during his work.   4.6 The applicant claimed that in mid-2012 his brother was nominated for the TNA in the provincial council elections. The applicant allegedly assisted his brother with the campaign for two weeks until he was stopped by the party that 'supported the government'.  The applicant claimed that on 17 July 2012 party members who supported the government smashed the applicant's car and physically assaulted him and his brother.  The application was refused on 9 December 2013.   The applicant applied to the RRT for review of the delegate's decision on 16 December 2013.   The applicant and his brother gave oral evidence before the RRT on 24 April 2015.  The RRT made its decision on 5 May 2015.  The decision of the Tribunal  On the basis of country information, the RRT accepted that the applicant was rounded up in 2001 and 2003 by the CID and the family was displaced.  It also accepted that the applicant was injured in a bomb blast as a child and was detained for 9 days in 2006 by people he suspected were associated with the Karuna group.  However, the RRT did not accept that the applicant faced harm from the Karuna group or other authorities because the conflict had since ended.  The RRT accepted that the applicant worked clearing mines but did not accept that he faced any harm from the CID as a result of this work.   The RRT accepted that the applicant's brother was nominated in the 2012 elections  but did not accept that the applicant or his brother were assaulted on the way back from nominating in the 2012 elections due to their inconsistent accounts.   The RRT considered the post hearing submissions of the applicant; but did not accept that they overcame the discrepancies present in their evidence.   Further, the RRT did not accept that the applicant made arrangements to leave Sri Lanka as a result of the claimed assault.   The RRT did not accept that the applicant had suffered any harm since 2006 or that anyone was looking for him or interested in him.  The RRT did not accept that the applicant or his brother were active members of the TNA or that they are interested in politics or would be in the future.   The RRT accepted that persons with LTTE associations may be at risk of harm upon return to Sri Lanka, however, did not accept that the applicant had such a profile to put him at risk of harm upon return to Sri Lanka.  The RRT accepted that the applicant was a Roman Catholic.  The RRT noted that the applicant did not claim that he was taken by Karuna because of his religion.  Accordingly, the RRT did not accept that the applicant faced a real chance of serious harm for reasons of his religion in the future.   The RRT accepted that the applicant departed illegally and that on the basis of country information, the applicant would be charged, bailed and fined upon return to Sri Lanka. The RRT found that Sri Lanka departure laws are laws of general application and therefore the enforcement of the laws did not constitute persecution.” Solicitor for the applicant, Mr Newman, made oral submissions that the RRT failed to analyse the applicant's circumstances in Sri Lanka so as to be satisfied of the applicant’s ability to pay a fine of up to 50,000 Sri Lankan Rupees, which, in Mr Newman's submission, is two-thirds of the annual salary of a person in Sri Lanka. The Court notes that there is no evidence to support such an assertion.  However, for the purposes of this hearing, I am prepared to accept that that may well be so. In the course of Mr Newman's oral submissions this morning, I put to Mr Newman that it appeared that 50,000 Sri Lankan Rupees was approximately $500AUD. Mr Newman maintained his submission that there was no analysis by the RRT as to satisfying itself that there was money back in Sri Lanka, either in the hands of the applicant or his family, to pay such a fine and, further, there was nothing before the RRT to satisfy it as to how the applicant would have the ability to pay such a fine. Mr Newman submitted that the RRT must set out its reasons for the decision it makes and that the RRT failed to do so in making its finding that the applicant would be able to pay the fine, even the maximum amount of 50,000 Sri Lankan Rupees, and that paying such a fine would not constitute significant harm. The RRT’s decision record identifies accurately the issue before it as being whether or not the applicant is a person entitled to protection obligations under the refugee criterion in s.36(2)(a) of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) (“the Act”), or under the complementary protection criterion ground in s.36(2)(aa) of the Act.   The RRT identified in its decision record the following key issues:  the credibility of the applicant;  whether Australia had protection obligations under the Refugee Convention to the applicant; and, whether Australia had obligations under the complementary protection criterion. The RRT then identified country information to which it had regard and upon which it relied in making its findings.  It is well settled that the country information to which the RRT has regard and the weight it gives that information is a matter for the RRT (see NAHI v Minister for Immigration & Multicultural & Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 10, and VWFW v Minister for Immigration & Multicultural & Indigenous Affairs  [2006] FCAFC 29). The RRT considered the applicant's credibility and ultimately did not accept the applicant's claims to have suffered past persecution or to be at risk of persecution if he was to return to Sri Lanka, or to be at risk of serious or significant harm.   The RRT’s decision record discloses various exchanges that it had with the applicant, and identifies matters of concern about the applicant's evidence that it put to him, and notes his responses.  The RRT’s findings would appear to be open to it on the materials and evidence before it, and for the reasons it gave, including its adverse credibility findings. Credibility findings are a matter par excellence for the RRT (see Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs; Ex parte Durairajasingham (2000) 168 ALR 407 at [67] per McHugh J). In relation to the applicant's return to Sri Lanka as an illegal departee, the RRT considered that issue in the following paragraphs:  “Illegal Departure  70. The tribunal referred to the DFAT information about the treatment of returnees, being questioned at the airport to establish identity, charged under the Immigrants and Emigrants Act (IEA) for illegal departure at the airport and brought before a court to apply for bail. In most cases returnees have been granted bail on personal recognisance immediately by the magistrate, with the requirement for a family member to act as guarantor or sometimes they need to wait until a family member comes to collect them. Eventually the returnee will need to return to Court to face the charges. Generally fines of 5,000 rupees are imposed, although the Negombo magistrate levies fines of around 50,000 to act as a deterrent. Further, DFAT was informed in March 2014 that no returnee who was just a passenger on a people smuggling venture had been given a custodial sentence for departing Sri Lanka illegally.  71. The tribunal accepts that the applicant departed the country illegally as he came by boat not through an authorised airport or a port and without a passport. The tribunal accepts on the basis of the country information that the applicant would be subjected to such processes on return, being charged, bailed  and fined up to 50,000 rupees.  72. The tribunal has considered the applicant’s circumstances and does not accept the fine amounts to serious harm because the tribunal considers he would be able to pay the fine because he has earned income in Sri Lanka previously and there is no reason he could not do so in the future. Further he is earning $850 a week in Australia, some of which he has been sending home, and also has the support of his family in Sri Lanka. The tribunal finds given his circumstances and the country information he will be bailed and if needed, his family would provide surety as he is [in] regular contact with them.”  (Citations omitted and emphasis added.) The key substance of those findings is that generally fines of 5,000 Sri Lankan Rupees are imposed, although fines of 50,000 Sri Lankan Rupees have been made to act as a deterrent. The RRT accepted that the applicant would be subjected to the usual processes regarding illegal deportees where he would be brought before a Sri Lankan Court to apply for bail and he was likely to be subjected to a fine of up to 50,000 Sri Lankan Rupees. The RRT then considered the applicant's particular circumstances. In considering whether or not such a fine would amount to serious harm to the applicant, the RRT was satisfied that the applicant would be able to pay the fine because he had earned an income in Sri Lanka previously. The RRT was satisfied that there was no reason to assume that the applicant could not do so in the future, especially in circumstances where he is presently earning $850AUD per week in Australia, a portion of which he has been sending home. Further, the RRT found that the applicant has the support of his family in Sri Lanka.  The RRT was also satisfied that the applicant’s family would provide surety for him as he is in regular contact with them.   In considering whether the applicant met the complementary protection criterion contained in s.36(2)(aa) of the Act, the RRT again accepted that, as a returnee to Sri Lanka who had departed illegally, the applicant may face being questioned at the airport, being arrested on charges of leaving the country illegally, potentially being remanded for a relatively short period pending a bail hearing and fined up to 50,000 Sri Lankan Rupees for his illegal departure. The RRT considered whether he was at risk of significant harm as contemplated by s.36(2A) of the Act. However, the RRT found that based on the country information to which it had referred, returnees were not mistreated in such a manner.  The RRT did not accept that questioning at the airport, being charged and bailed, payment of the fine, or being held in remand for a short period, constituted significant harm for the purposes of s.36(2A) of the Act. Ultimately, the RRT found that the applicant would be able to pay the fine, even the maximum amount of 50,000 Sri Lankan Rupees, and that such a fine would not constitute ‘significant harm.’ I did not accept the submission of Mr Newman that the RRT did not provide reasons for its conclusion that the applicant would be able to pay a fine of 50,000 Sri Lankan Rupees and that such payment would not constitute significant harm. Insofar as the ground of the Amended Application asserts that the RRT erred in failing to consider that, notwithstanding the laws of Sri Lanka, the applicant was confined to a class of persons, namely those who place no faith in the Sri Lanka government's protection and who chose to leave clandestinely, such an assertion is not made out in the face of the RRT’s decision record.    The RRT specifically referred to country information in respect of Sri Lankan citizens who had departed illegally. The RRT noted that it had regard to Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade information about the treatment of returnees being questioned at the airport to establish identity, charged under the Sri Lankan Immigrants and Emigrants Act of illegal departure at the airport, and being brought before a Sri Lankan Court for bail. In the circumstances, the RRT’s findings and conclusions would appear to be open to it on the evidence and material before it, and for the reasons it gave. Otherwise, the complaints in the applicant’s Amended Application do not identify any jurisdictional error on the part of the RRT and appears more to be a disagreement with the findings and conclusions of the RRT. The applicant’s complaints, such as they are, invite merits review which this Court cannot undertake (see Abebe v Commonwealth of Australia [1999] HCA 14;  (1999) 197 CLR 510 at 53-54; Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Wu Shan Liang and Ors (1996) 185 CLR 259 at 272 per Brennan CJ, Toohey, McHugh and Gummow JJ).  Whilst there is no direct mention in the ground of the Amended Application of any reliance on the decision of North J in WZAPN v Minister for Immigration and Border Protection [2015] FCA 947, if such a complaint was intended to be made, such an approach has been overruled by the High Court of Australia in Minister for Immigration and Border Protection v WZAPN & Anor  [2015] HCA 22 (endorsing the Full Court of the Federal Court of Australia in SZTEQ v Minister for Immigration and Border Protection [2015] FCAFC 39, SZTIB v Minister for Immigration and Border Protection [2015] FCAFC 40, and BZAFM v Minister for Immigration and Border Protection [2015] FCAFC 41). While I make no final decision as to whether or not the RRT’s decision is affected by jurisdictional error, the applicant has not identified any error on the part of the RRT that is capable of establishing jurisdictional error and none is apparent on the face of the decision record. The RRT referred to the relevant law in affirming the decision under review.  In the circumstances, I am not satisfied that the applicant has raised an arguable case for the relief claimed.   Accordingly, in the exercise of the Court's discretion under r.44.12(1) of the Rules and on the basis that the application does not raise an arguable case, the proceeding before this Court, commenced by way of application filed on 18 May 2015, should be dismissed with costs.I certify that the preceding thirty-eight (38) paragraphs are a true copy of the reasons for judgment of Judge EmmettAssociate:  Date:  21 July 2015       \",\n",
       " 'AVX15 v Minister for Immigration & Anor [2015] FCCA 3012 (9 November 2015)': \"  This is an application for a Constitutional writ within the Court’s jurisdiction under s.476 of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) in respect of a decision of the Tribunal made on 1 May 2015 affirming a decision of the delegate not to grant the applicant a protection visa.  The applicant was found to be a citizen of China and his claim for protection and complementary protection were assessed against that country.  The applicant arrived in Australia on a subclass 600 visitor visa on 11 November 2013 and applied for protection on 7 February 2014. On 13 June 2014, the delegate refused an application for a protection visa and the applicant applied for a review before the Tribunal.  By a letter dated 25 March 2015, the Tribunal invited the applicant to appear at a hearing on 28 April 2015.  The applicant appeared on that date to give evidence and present arguments and was assisted by an interpreter as well as being represented by his registered migration agent.   The applicant claimed to fear harm from his former employer and the police.  The applicant claimed he worked at a furniture factory and that his employer failed to pay wages for several months and the applicant claimed he organised approximately 160 people to protest.  The applicant alleged he was subsequently assaulted, arrested and detained by his former employer and the police.  The applicant claimed that he was later alleged to be the leader of the riot and was interrogated by the police until he confessed and was transferred to the Ouhai Detention Centre.   The applicant claimed that he was released on bail for medical treatment after his wife bribed the police and he was required to report to the Ouhai Public Security Bureau twice a week.  The applicant further claimed that since he left China, he has been regarded as a person who fled to escape punishment and the applicant says he will be subjected to persecution on his return.  From the bar table, the applicant said he cannot return to China and wanted the protection of the law.   On 16 July 2015, a Registrar of the Court fixed the matter for hearing today and made orders providing an opportunity for the applicant to file an amended application, affidavit evidence and submissions.  No such documents were filed.  The application identifies under the grounds of the application the following grounds:  1, I am a Chinese citizen. I have been persecuted and discriminated by Chinese authority and have a fear of return to origin.  2, I will be in a great danger if I am forced to leave Australia.  3, RRT unreasonable suspect of the truthfulness of my claims  4, Tribunal's over objective in judging the explanation and the response of the applicant at the hearing The application also discloses what appear to be grounds under Orders Sought:  1, I don't think DIAC and RRT's decision are fair and reasonable as they failed to take a good consideration in my claim, ignoring my background and actual persecution in China.  2, RRT failed to prudently consider my risk if I return to origin.  3, RRT failed to consider my statements, explanation, and evidence provided in supporting my claim as a whole. The Tribunal found the applicant was frequently evasive and vague, and various aspects of his evidence were confused and inconsistent.  Having considered all of the evidence, the Tribunal did not accept the applicant was a truthful witness or that he had been truthful in his account of his experiences in China and the reasons for leaving China.  The Tribunal found that the applicant’s claims had been fabricated, relevantly, in paras.18 and 22:  18. The Tribunal considers that the applicant’s evidence as set out above in relation to his involvement in the dispute is unpersuasive. As discussed during the hearing, the Tribunal accepts that there have been cases of workers in factories in China who have been the victims of unscrupulous employees. However, the evidence which was discussed with the applicant both during the Department interview and the Tribunal hearing indicates that major changes have been made to industrial relations laws to regulate both public and private companies. These laws have provided mechanisms for dispute resolution and arbitration processes. The Tribunal considers that the applicant’s evidence that he was elected to be the employee advocate of 160 people, in circumstances where he had only joined the company some 14 months before that time; where he had no knowledge of his own employment basis or contractual obligations; and made no attempts to make inquiries in relation to mechanisms for resolving such disputes, is not credible. The Tribunal accepts that the applicant may not have known about avenues for dispute resolution at the time the company initially failed to pay wages, but does not accept that someone who was elected to be the representative of a large group of people who was considering protesting about the failure of the organisation to pay its workers, would have not made inquiries regarding mechanisms for workplace dispute over the course of several months when the workers were not paid. The Tribunal further considers that the applicant’s evidence during the hearing, indicating that he had no knowledge of the amount of money owed to the factory’s employees either when he organised them to protest or when the company closed, is also not credible. The Tribunal does not accept that a person who was organising a protest in relation to unpaid wages would make no attempts to determine the amount of money owed by the company to its employees who had purportedly not been paid for several months, or that a person who knew nothing about workplace wage disputes would be elected the leader of a large group of people. The Tribunal does not accept the applicant’s explanation for why he would not have made inquiries in relation to this issue; why he would have failed to make inquiries into workplace laws or dispute resolution processes for persons who were owed wages by their employee; or why he would be elected as the representative of a large group of employees. The Tribunal considers that the evidence in relation to this issue is indicative of the fact that the applicant’s claims have been fabricated.  ...  22. Although the Tribunal accepts that an interview and hearing are stressful processes, the Tribunal does not accept the applicant’s explanation for his “confusion” in relation to the date of his release from detention. The applicant has claimed to have been detained on only one occasion in China. The Tribunal does not accept that he would be unable to recall the date on which he was purportedly released on “medical grounds”. The Tribunal considers that the evidence in relation to this issue is further indicative of the fact that the applicant’s claims have been fabricated. It was in those circumstances that the Tribunal made the following findings:  27. ... The Tribunal is not satisfied that there is a real chance that the applicant will suffer serious harm for reasons of his actual or imputed political opinion or for any other Convention reason if he returns to China now or in the reasonably foreseeable future. The Tribunal finds, therefore, that the applicant does not have a well founded fear of persecution in China. The Tribunal then turned to the issue of complementary protection and relevantly found:  28. ...For the same reasons as discussed above, the Tribunal is not satisfied that there is a real risk that the applicant will suffer significant harm as a result of the reasons he has claimed. It was in those circumstances the Tribunal found the applicant was not a person in respect of whom Australia had a protection obligation and that the applicant did not satisfy the criteria under ss.36(2)(a) or 36(2)(aa) of the Migration Act 1958. In relation to ground 1 identified in the application, I accept the first respondent’s submission that this is, in substance, an impermissible challenge to the adverse findings made by the Tribunal and does not disclose any jurisdictional error.   In relation to ground 2, this fails to identify any jurisdictional error and again is an impermissible invitation for the Court to consider the merits of the application which were a matter for the Tribunal.   In relation to ground 3, it was a matter for the Tribunal to evaluate the credit of the applicant and it cannot be said that the adverse findings of credit lack an evident and intelligible justification.  The Tribunal provided a reasoned basis on the evidence before it that supported the findings.  Ground 3 fails to identify any jurisdictional error. In relation to ground 4, insofar as it advances an allegation of bias, that is a ground that must be clearly alleged and properly proved.  No such allegation of bias is proved.  To the extent that there is a reference to the over-objective judging, that appears to be a reference to the adverse findings.  Adverse findings are not a proper basis upon which an allegation of bias can be made out.  Further, no fair minded lay observer, by reason of the adverse findings, might reasonably apprehend that the Tribunal might not bring a fair and impartial mind to the determination of the matter on its merits.  Ground 4 fails to make out any jurisdictional error. In relation to the orders sought, insofar as prayer 1 refers to the delegate, the conduct of the delegate is not a basis upon which jurisdictional error can be made out before this Court.  Insofar as there is reference to the Tribunal, the generalised assertion that the decision was not fair and reasonable fails to make out any jurisdictional error.  It is clear that the Tribunal took into account the applicant’s evidence but did not accept the applicant.   It is clear that the Tribunal took into account the applicant’s evidence and background and claims and made adverse findings dispositive of the applicant’s claims.  Prayer 1 of the orders sought fails to make out any jurisdictional error. Prayer 2 of the orders sought is again an impermissible challenge to the adverse findings of the Tribunal and fails to make out any jurisdictional error.  Prayer 3 of the orders sought asserts a failure to consider the applicant’s statements, explanation and evidence which is clearly contradicted by the reasons of the Tribunal.  Relevantly, the Tribunal in paras.5 to 10, and paras.15 to 26 engaged in a careful review of the evidence.  Prayer 3 of the orders sought fails to make out any jurisdictional error.   Nothing said by the applicant identified any basis upon which there could be said to be a jurisdictional error by the Tribunal.  The application is dismissed.I certify that the preceding eighteen (18) paragraphs are a true copy of the reasons for judgment of Judge StreetAssociate:  Date:  10 November 2015       \",\n",
       " 'AXQ15 v Minister for Immigration & Anor [2015] FCCA 3195 (1 December 2015)': '  This is an application for a Constitutional writ within the Court’s jurisdiction under s.476 of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) in respect of a decision of the Tribunal made on 29 April 2015 affirming the decision of the delegate not to grant the applicant a protection visa.  The applicant was found to be a citizen of Sri Lanka, and his claims were assessed against that country. The applicant left Sri Lanka on 3 June 2012 and entered Australia as an illegal maritime arrival, arriving at Christmas Island on 24 June 2012.   In substance, the claims of the applicant were that he feared harm based on his Tamil ethnicity, his imputed LTTE political opinion due to both his ethnicity and origins from the Northern Province, his membership of the political social group of Tamil business owners or their family members, and membership of a particular social group of failed Tamil asylum seekers, as well as being an illegal departee from Sri Lanka.  The ground of the amended application is as follows:  Ground 1  The decision of the AAT is affected by error because the reasoning at [70] is so illogical and/or so inconsistent with the findings at [63] that it should be set aside: This was a case where the applicant had, for a period of six years, relocated from his home province and worked for his uncle at a particular location for a period of six years.  The applicant returned to his home area in early 2010, and, as a result of his treatment, he returned to the location where he had been working with his uncle from May 2010 until December 2011.   The applicant returned to his home location due to his mother’s illness in December 2011 until his departure for Australia in June 2012 and was subjected by the army to a requirement of unpaid work, and the army visited the applicant’s home and threatened and intimidated the applicant and his family in his home area.  The Tribunal also found that the army in [J] made inquiries about the applicant after his departure from Australia.   The Tribunal found that the applicant, in his home area, had been exposed to conduct by the army that constituted serious harm.  The Tribunal identified that the targeting by the army in that home area had been opportunistic and that the harm was localised and explained reasons for that finding.  Relevantly, the Tribunal found:  44. The applicant’s adviser has submitted that the applicant’s home area should be considered as [J] for the purposes of this assessment. Whilst the Tribunal considers there are strong arguments to suggest that the applicant has two home areas, namely [J] and [B], given the extensive period of time in which he has lived in [B] over the last eight years, and his family and work ties there, the Tribunal assesses the applicant’s claim on the basis of his home area being [J], and considers [B] as a relocation option for the applicant.  ...  63. In terms of the applicant being forced to work for the army in [J], the Tribunal has been satisfied with the truth of the applicant’s evidence in this respect. The Tribunal is satisfied that the applicant has been a target by the army in [J] and subject to forced labour on multiple occasions. It accepts that he and his family have been intimidated by the army on occasions when the applicant has not been able to work for them. The Tribunal accepts that on one occasion, during the first period of adverse treatment by the army in [J], the applicant was made to strip and kneel in the sun. The Tribunal is of the view that the extent of the forced labour, and given the power of the army to ensure compliance, that the applicant has suffered a threat to his liberty that would constitute serious harm for the purposes of s.91R(1)(b) and 91R(2)(a).  64. The Tribunal considers that the essential and significant reason that the applicant was picked upon to undertake forced labour is his Tamil ethnicity, and that s.91R(1)(a) of the Act is satisfied. The Tribunal is satisfied that the persecution involves systematic and discriminatory conduct, satisfying s.91R(c) of the Act.  ...  66. The Tribunal considers the extent to which the serious harm that the applicant has a real chance of facing in [J], is localised to [J]. If localised, the potential for relocation needs to be considered. In particular, considering the applicant’s extensive links to [B], the Tribunal considers whether it is reasonable for the applicant to relocate to [B] to avoid the harm.  67. The Tribunal considers that the targeting by the army in [J] of the applicant is opportunistic. He has been targeted because he is Tamil, who are marginalised by the Sri Lankan authorities, and the majority Sinhalese, and because he provides a ready opportunity for free labour. The Tribunal does not consider that the applicant has been targeted for any other reason, including suspicion of LTTE involvement or that he presents a risk to the security of the state. The Tribunal considers that the harm is localised to the [J] area. In this respect, it notes that the targeting of the applicant began before he returned to [B] in 2010. The applicant provided no evidence that the difficulties that he faced in [J] in this period followed him to [B], such as by the army informing authorities in [B] that the applicant was a person of adverse interest. Indeed, the applicant has given evidence that that police visited the shop on his return to [B] but he was not required to register as he was vouched for by his uncle. This is one factor that suggests to the Tribunal that the harm is localised and there is not a targeting of him by an agency of the state which will follow him  to other parts of Sri Lanka.  68. It was submitted in the Tribunal hearing, and in the subsequent written submission, that the conduct of the army during the applicant’s second period in [J] was more intense than the first, meaning that the lack of adverse interest in [B] after the initial period is not necessarily suggestive of what might happen now.  69. The Tribunal does not accept that submission. If there was a broader targeting of the applicant beyond the opportunistic treatment of him, the Tribunal considers that this would have resulted in adverse interest from authorities in [B] when he again moved there in May 2010, noting that the applicant’s evidence of the treatment by the army of him in [J] before that point in time was significant, including being made to strip and kneel in the sun. The Tribunal considers that the adverse treatment of the applicant by the army in [J] is localised to that area, and the targeting of authorities towards him in that area will not follow him to other parts of Sri Lanka.  70. The Tribunal notes that DFAT Country Report – Sri Lanka comments that is unlikely  that individuals can relocate internally within Sri Lanka with any degree of anonymity.19 The UNHCR Eligibility Guidelines for Sri Lanka state that internal flight or relocation   is not available whether feared persecution emanates from the state itself or elements associated with it. However, DFAT assesses that individuals do generally have the ability to relocate internally to minimise monitoring or harassment by local level officials for petty issues.20  71. The Tribunal considers that the evidence in this case establishes that the harm suffered by the applicant in [J] is opportunistic and localised. Past experience suggests that no adverse interest by the army in [J] has followed the applicant to [B].  Whilst the Tribunal accepts that the issues faced by the applicant in [J] are not petty from his perspective, he has not been targeted as a person of adverse interest to the state, and the Tribunal considers that the treatment of the applicant by the army is conduct of a nature referred to in the qualification of in the DFAT assessment.  72. In terms of the reasonableness of the applicant relocating to [B], the Tribunal takes into account that the applicant has lived in [B] over extensive periods in the recent past. The applicant resided in [B] for a total period of more than six    years over the eight years from 2004 until 2012. In fact, [B] was virtually a second home to the applicant, and he claims to have travelled there as a safe haven from problems in [J] as well as in [C]. The applicant has family in [B] -his uncle - and, to date, through his uncle, he has had work.  73. When the Tribunal put to the applicant in the hearing the potential for him to move to [B], the applicant said that his uncle is now old and unwell and that he does not want him in the business working for him. The applicant indicated that his uncle has employed two local Tamils. These points were reiterated in the written submission provided following the hearing.  74. The Tribunal is prepared to accept that the applicant’s uncle maybe getting old and is unwell, and spending less time in the business. The Tribunal is not satisfied, however, that his uncle does not want him in the business working for him. That is not consistent with the applicant’s uncle’s past willingness to facilitate the applicant leaving difficulties in [J] or [C]. The Tribunal also notes that in the applicant’s adviser’s detailed submission to the Department on relocation to [B], no claim is made on this basis. The Tribunal considers the applicant’s claims in this respect are manufactured.  75. The Tribunal asked the applicant why he would not be in a position to work outside his uncle’s business, for example as a painter in [B]. The applicant said that he has no contacts in [B], and that the Karuna group might still extort him for money if he worked as a painter. In relation to the first point, the applicant gave evidence in the hearing that when in [B], his uncle insisted that he never leave the shop or their home, and as a result he formed no social group or friends or contacts. The Tribunal does not accept this. It does not accept that the applicant would have lived in [B] for a period of a total of six years and not formed any local connections, notwithstanding security concerns.  76. In assessing reasonableness, the potential for the applicant and his uncle’s business to be extorted by the Karuna group needs to be considered. The Tribunal considers that the applicant has exaggerated the extent of requests for money and goods given that the applicant’s uncle has continued his business for 30 years, which still operates. The Tribunal has accepted that the applicant himself had to pay out a total of Rs.10,000. Over a period of six years, the Tribunal does not consider this an amount which would constitute serious and significant harm to the applicant. The Tribunal accepts that the applicant would suffer on account of money and goods taken from his uncle, but it does not consider that this has happened to an extent that has created serious or significant harm to the applicant’s uncle.  77. The Tribunal does not consider that any pattern of requests for money that may happen in the future from the Karuna group, or any other group, will increase beyond that which has happened in the past. The Tribunal is not satisfied that if the applicant works as a painter that he will be subject to requests for money from the Karuna group that leads to a real chance of serious harm. The independent information suggests that groups target ‘businessman’. The Tribunal does not consider that an individual undertaking painting work on his own account falls within this category.  78. The applicant has claimed in the hearing that he is more at risk than his uncle because he is a young Tamil from [B]. The Tribunal considers, if this were the case now, it would have been even more the case during the period of the civil conflict, yet the applicant made no claim to this effect in his detailed written statement or in his evidence to the delegate of the Minister. The Tribunal does not accept the applicant’s claim that he is more at risk on this basis.  79. The Tribunal notes that there is no claim that either the applicant or his uncle had suffered physical harm from the Karuna group or any other group.  80. For all these reasons, the Tribunal does not consider that there exists, in the reasonably foreseeable future, a real chance of the applicant facing serious harm as a result of requests for money or goods, or threats by the Karuna group, or any other group, in [B].  81. The Tribunal considers, in light of this assessment, given the applicant’s past time spent in [B] and his family connections, that it would be reasonable for the applicant to relocate to [B] to avoid harm in [J], where he would be in a position to work either for his uncle or on his own account as a painter. While the Tribunal accepts that the operation of groups such as the Karana groups may create a difficult atmosphere for businesses in [B], it is to be noted that the Refugees Convention is concerned with persecution in the defined sense, and not with living conditions in a broader sense  82. Considering all the circumstances and evidence, the Tribunal considers that it is reasonable for the applicant to relocate permanently to [B] to escape harm faced by the army in [J] by being forced to work, and in relation to intimidating treatment based on ethnicity.  83. In terms of claims more broadly based on the discrimination of Tamils, the Tribunal accepts that life for Tamils in Sri Lanka is difficult and that they are subject to discrimination. As is implicit in the UNHCR guidelines, discrimination generally speaking against Tamils does not reach a level that would constitute persecution. The applicant’s particular circumstances need to be considered but there is nothing in those circumstances, beyond the issues already addressed, that would lead the Tribunal to conclude that there is a real chance of the applicant facing serious harm as a result of discriminatory treatment.  ...  113. The Tribunal does not consider that there is anything in the applicant’s past or profile that creates a real chance of serious harm during the process of questioning at the airport. The Tribunal considers that the applicant is likely be allowed to re-enter Sri Lanka following a brief period of questioning.  114. In terms of the follow up in his home area, the Tribunal assesses this on the basis that the applicant would relocate to [B]. The Tribunal does not consider that there is any risk to the applicant based on questioning that will occur when he returns to [B]. The Tribunal notes that in the interview with the delegate of the Minister, the applicant was asked whether he needed to register when he went to [B] in 2010. The applicant responded that police visited the shop and because they knew he was a relative of the applicant’s uncle, he did not have to go and register. It is to be noted that this was at a time after the applicant had suffered harm from the army in [J]. This suggests that the applicant is already known in [B], and is not a person of adverse interest. The Tribunal considers there is nothing in the applicant’s profile that would create a real chance of serious harm during the process of questioning when he would return to [B].  ...  117. On the basis of all the independent evidence, including evidence provided by the applicant’s adviser, the Tribunal assesses the risk of serious harm to the applicant as a result of him being a failed asylum seeker as less than a real chance, other than the risk of a period of detention whilst being investigated at the airport. In term of the risk of being detained, the Tribunal does not accept that any harm that might be suffered by the applicant amounts to persecution because it does not meet the requirements of s.91R(1)(a) or (c).  118. Based on the totality of the evidence, the Tribunal is not satisfied that the applicant’s circumstances give rise to the applicant facing differential treatment for a Convention reason or reveal a real chance of persecution involving serious harm in connection with the applicant’s unsuccessful application for asylum now or in the reasonably foreseeable future.  ...  130. The Tribunal has determined each of the applicant’s claims relating to the Refugees Convention and concluded that under the claims on the basis of ethnicity, the applicant does face a real chance of serious harm in [J]. However, the Tribunal has concluded that the harm is localised to [J] and it would be reasonable for the applicant to relocate to [B], such that the applicant does not have a well-founded fear of persecution should he be returned to Sri Lanka.  131. The Tribunal has determined the other claims relating to the Refugees Convention and determined that under none of these claims does the applicant face a real chance of serious harm, or otherwise satisfy the requirements of s.91R(1), for any of the reasons claimed or arising on the evidence.  The Tribunal also considers the applicant’s claims cumulatively.  132. Based on all the evidence before it, including the applicant’s claimed past circumstances, and what is accepted of his current personal and family circumstances and profile in Sri Lanka, the Tribunal is not satisfied that the applicant faces a real chance of serious harm, or otherwise satisfies the requirements of s.91R(1), for any of the reasons claimed, or cumulatively, or arising on the evidence, with the exception of harm in [J] on the basis of ethnicity, which the applicant can avoid by relocating. It follows that the Tribunal is not satisfied that the applicant faces a well-founded fear of persecution for a Convention reason in Sri Lanka now or in the reasonably foreseeable future and that the Tribunal is not satisfied that the applicant is a refugee under s.36(2)(a) of the Act.  Complementary Protection  133.  It is submitted that, if the applicant is not found to be refugee, he is eligible for complementary protection. This requires that there are substantial grounds for believing that, as a necessary and foreseeable consequence of the applicant being removed from Australia to a receiving country, there is a real risk that he or she will suffer significant harm: s.36(2)(aa).  ...  137.  The Tribunal considers that the harm inflicted on the applicant by the army in [J] in the past, namely being forced against his will to work, being stripped and forced to kneel in the sun, cumulatively amounts to conduct which causes and is intended to cause extreme humiliation.  ...  139.  For the reasons canvassed in the section of this decision relating to relocation under the Refugees Convention claims, the Tribunal considers that the significant harm faced by the applicant is localised to [J] and, given all the circumstances, it is reasonable for the applicant to avoid that harm by relocating to [B]. The Tribunal is not satisfied that the nature and the extent of requests for money and goods by the Karuna group, or any other group, that the applicant has a real risk of facing, would constitute cruel or inhuman treatment or punishment, or degrading treatment or punishment. The Tribunal is not satisfied that requests in the future – based on what has happened in the past - would cause or be intended to cause ‘extreme humiliation’, being a requirement of the definition of ‘degrading treatment or punishment’.  140. Other than the opportunistic interest by the army in [J] in the applicant, the Tribunal does not consider that Sri Lankan authorities have any adverse interest in the applicant that would cause him to be at a real risk of suffering any definition of significant harm, and refers to the analysis in the assessment of the Refugees Convention. This includes the process of investigation and questioning at the airport, and questioning on return to [B]. The Tribunal does not consider that the questioning, detentions and threats that occurred to the applicant during the course of the civil conflict result in a real risk of the applicant suffering significant harm if he returns to Nepal.  141. In terms of the potential for discrimination more generally, beyond the harm inflicted  by the army on the applicant in [J], the Tribunal does accept that Tamils in Sri Lanka face discrimination, as outlined in the independent information. Discrimination,          for example, occurs in university education, government employment and other matters controlled by the government. The Tribunal notes the view of UNHCR that being a Tamil itself does not establish a right to protection based mechanisms – including complementary forms of protection which supports the proposition that the level of discrimination against Tamils in Sri Lanka per se does not reach a level that would constitute significant harm. The Tribunal does not consider there is anything in the applicant’s personal circumstances that would create a real risk of the applicant suffering significant harm based on generalised discriminatory treatment.  142. The applicant’s adviser provided a report indicating instances where returned asylum seekers had to pay bribes. That report also indicated that returned asylum seekers may be targeted because they were perceived as wealthy. In considering the totality of the independent information referred to in this decision and by the applicant’s adviser, the Tribunal is not satisfied that it establishes that there is a real risk that the applicant would be forced to pay bribes or would be targeted due to a perception of wealth to an extent that will constitute significant harm.  ...  144.  There are no reports of returnees being given custodial sentences. The Tribunal considers the risk of the applicant being detained for an extended period is remote, based on his personal circumstances.  ...  146.  While the Tribunal has accepted that the applicant faces a real risk of significant harm by the army in [J], the Tribunal finds that harm is localised and it would be reasonable for the applicant to avoid harm by relocating to [B]. In relation to the applicant’s other claims, considered both singularly and cumulatively, the Tribunal is not satisfied that the applicant faces a real risk of treatment amounting to significant harm as contemplated by s.36(2A) of the Act. The Tribunal is not satisfied on the information before it that there are substantial grounds for believing that, as a necessary and foreseeable consequence of the applicant being removed from Australia to Sri Lanka, he faces a real risk of: being arbitrarily deprived of his life; the death penalty being carried out on him; being subject to torture; being subject to cruel or inhuman treatment or punishment; or being subject to degrading treatment or punishment for any reason claimed or arising on the evidence. Mr Hodges, the solicitor for the applicant, focused on para.70, above, in the context of the finding in para.63 of conduct of treatment of the applicant that was found to constitute serious harm.  Mr Hodges submitted that serious harm by the army was not something that could fall within the qualification identified in the last sentence to para.70 and that it was illogical and irrational and unreasonable to come to such a finding.   Mr Hodges submitted that the treatment involving forced labour on multiple occasions and being made to strip and kneel in the sun was not treatment that could be characterised as “monitoring or harassment ... for petty issues”.  Mr Hodges also submitted that the army were not “local level officials” and that the conduct of the army found in para.63 could not rationally be said to be conduct falling within the qualification in the DFAT report identified in para.70.   Mr Hodges submitted that the qualification, found in para.71, of the harm suffered being opportunistic was not consistent with the finding in para.63 and was irrelevant as a characterisation and that the description of the harm suffered being “localised” equally failed to identify a rational basis for the findings made by the Tribunal.  Notwithstanding the focus in ground 1 only upon para.70, it was clear from Mr Hodges’ submissions that his argument was addressed to illogicality or irrationality by reference to para.70, 71 and para.82.   Mr Hodges put that the last clause of the last sentence of para.71 should be construed as the Tribunal characterising the treatment of the applicant as being of a kind falling wholly within the qualification in the last sentence in para.70 and equating the army with being a local level official.  In my opinion, the reasons of the Tribunal have to be read as a whole.  On a fair reading, the Tribunal was well alive to the distinction between the army and the local level officials.   Further, the Tribunal recognised the significance of the finding made in para.63 in relation to the description found in the last sentence at para.70 so far as conduct is concerned and the reference to “...the treatment of the applicant” being, “...conduct of the nature referred to in the qualification of the DFDA tier system” was a finding of fact by the Tribunal that cannot be said to lack an evident and intelligible justification. The Tribunal was entitled in the present case to take into account the relocation that had occurred by the applicant and the nature of the conduct that had occurred in the applicant’s home area.  It is clear that was the subject of careful consideration by the Tribunal as identified in paras.67 and 69.  The limited opportunistic nature of that conduct by the army was also identified in para.140.   In my opinion, on a fair reading of the Tribunal decision, para.71 in the last clause of the last sentence is not to be read as saying that the army was a local level official but rather was focused upon the treatment and the nature of the conduct as identified in the language used by the Tribunal.   Given the applicant’s history, there was clearly an evidentiary basis for the Tribunal’s finding in respect of the opportunistic and local nature of the treatment to which the applicant had been exposed.  The Tribunal also recognised that the treatment was not one that neatly fell within the concept of being petty from the perspective of the applicant.   Nonetheless, it is clear that the Tribunal did take into account the nature of the treatment that had been identified in para.63 in its ultimate finding as to the reasonableness of the applicant being able to relocate permanently to the area in which he had worked with his uncle for a substantial period of time as identified in para.82.   Moreover, it is clear that the Tribunal recognised in para.82 that it was the army that was the subject of the applicant’s fear.  In my opinion the adverse findings by the Tribunal as to the applicant’s ability to relocate cannot be said to lack an evident and intelligible justification.   I do not accept that the reasoning in paras.70 or 71 is so illogical or irrational as to give rise to any jurisdictional error.  I do not accept that the reasoning in paras.70, 71 and 82 is inconsistent with the finding made in para.63 so as to give rise to any jurisdictional error.  Ground 1 of the amended application fails to make out any jurisdictional error.  The amended application is dismissed.I certify that the preceding sixteen (16) paragraphs are a true copy of the reasons for judgment of Judge StreetAssociate:  Date:  2 December 2015       ',\n",
       " 'Ahmed v Minister for Immigration & Anor [2015] FCCA 2300 (24 July 2015)': ' Introduction  The applicant, who is a citizen of Pakistan, applied for a Student (Temporary) (Class TU) subclass 572 visa on 10 September 2012.  On 4 December 2012 a delegate of the first respondent (“Minister”) refused the applicant’s application on the basis that he did not satisfy Public Interest Criterion 4020 (“PIC 4020”) of sch.4 to the Migration Regulations 1994 (“Regulations”).  The applicant then applied to the Migration Review Tribunal (“Tribunal”), a predecessor of the second respondent, for a review of that departmental decision and on 18 December 2013 the Tribunal affirmed the delegate’s decision to refuse him a visa. On 29 January 2014 the applicant applied to this Court for judicial review of the Tribunal’s decision: item 15AG of sch.9 to the Tribunals Amalgamation Act 2015.  That application was filed outside the limitation period prescribed by s.477 of the Migration Act 1958 (“Act”) and so the applicant has applied for an extension of that limitation period. For the reasons which follow, the application for an extension of the time within which to bring these proceedings will be dismissed. Relevant law  The criteria for the grant of a subclass 572 visa are set out in pt.572 of sch.2 to the Regulations.  One of the criteria which the applicant had to satisfy at the time a decision was made on his application was cl.572.224(a) which relevantly required him to satisfy PIC 4020. At the time the delegate and Tribunal made their decisions, PIC 4020 relevantly provided:  (1) There is no evidence before the Minister that the applicant has given, or caused to be given, to the Minister, an officer, the Migration Review Tribunal, a relevant assessing authority or a Medical Officer of the Commonwealth, a bogus document or information that is false or misleading in a material particular in relation to:  (a) the application for the visa; ...  ...  (4) The Minister may waive the requirements of any or all of paragraphs (1) (a) or (b) and subclause (2) if satisfied that:  (a) compelling circumstances that affect the interests of Australia; or  (b) compassionate or compelling circumstances that affect the interests of an Australian citizen, an Australian permanent resident or an eligible New Zealand citizen;  justify the granting of the visa.  (5) In this clause:  information that is false or misleading in a material particular means information that is:  (a) false or misleading at the time it is given; and  (b) relevant to any of the criteria the Minister may consider when making a decision on an application, whether or not the decision is made because of that information. At the time the delegate and Tribunal made their decisions, the term “bogus document” was defined in s.97 of the Act as:  ... a document that the Minister reasonably suspects is a document that:  (a) purports to have been, but was not, issued in respect of the person; or  (b) is counterfeit or has been altered by a person who does not have authority to do so; or  (c) was obtained because of a false or misleading statement, whether or not made knowingly. Also relevant to this case are ss.359A, 359C, 360 and 379A of the Act which relevantly provide:    359A Information and invitation given in writing by Tribunal  (1)  Subject to subsections (2) and (3), the Tribunal must:  (a)  give to the applicant, in the way that the Tribunal considers appropriate in the circumstances, clear particulars of any information that the Tribunal considers would be the reason, or a part of the reason, for affirming the decision that is under review; and  (b)  ensure, as far as is reasonably practicable, that the applicant understands why it is relevant to the review, and the consequences of it being relied on in affirming the decision that is under review; and  (c)  invite the applicant to comment on or respond to it.  (2)  The information and invitation must be given to the applicant:  (a)  except where paragraph (b) applies—by one of the methods specified in section 379A; or  ...  359C Failure to give information, comments or response in response to written invitation  ...  (2)  If the applicant:  (a)  is invited under section 359A to comment on or respond to information; and  (b)  does not give the comments or the response before the time for giving them has passed;  the Tribunal may make a decision on the review without taking any further action to obtain the applicant’s views on the information.  ...  360 Tribunal must invite applicant to appear  (1)  The Tribunal must invite the applicant to appear before the Tribunal to give evidence and present arguments relating to the issues arising in relation to the decision under review.  (2)  Subsection (1) does not apply if:  ...  (c)  subsection 359C(1) or (2) applies to the applicant.  ...  379A Methods by which Tribunal gives documents to a person other than the Secretary  Coverage of section  (1)  For the purposes of provisions of this Part or the regulations that:  (a)  require or permit the Tribunal to give a document to a person (the recipient); and  (b)  state that the Tribunal must do so by one of the methods specified in this section;  the methods are as follows.  ...  Dispatch by prepaid post or by other prepaid means  (4)  Another method consists of a member or an officer of the Tribunal dating the document, and then dispatching it:  (a)  within 3 working days (in the place of dispatch) of the date of the document; and  (b)  by prepaid post or by other prepaid means; and  (c)  to:  (i)  the last address for service provided to the Tribunal by the recipient in connection with the review; or  (ii)  the last residential or business address provided to the Tribunal by the recipient in connection with the review; or  (iii)  if the recipient is a minor—the last address for a carer of the minor that is known by the member or officer.  ... Background facts  As already noted, the applicant applied for a student visa on 10 September 2012.  On 2 October 2012, following a request for further information on his financial capacity, the applicant provided to the Minister’s department (“Department”) a letter dated 24 September 2012 purportedly issued by the Barclays Bank in the United Kingdom.  The letter certified that the applicant’s father had borrowed £45,000 to finance the applicant’s education in Australia. On 18 October 2012 the Department wrote to the applicant advising him that the Barclays Bank loan letter had been found to be “non-genuine” and inviting him to provide an explanation of the document.  In response the applicant said that the document had been provided by a consultant whom he had engaged to arrange a loan.  He said that he was shocked that the document was not genuine. In refusing the applicant’s application, the delegate did not accept that the applicant had had no knowledge concerning the genuineness of the bank letter.  She was not satisfied that the applicant met PIC 4020 or that circumstances existed which justified the waiving of that criterion. The Tribunal’s decision and reasons  On 18 November 2013 the Tribunal wrote to the applicant inviting him to provide by 11 December 2013 comments on or a response to information that the Barclays letter provided to the Department was bogus.  The applicant was advised that if he did not provide his comments or response within the period allowed or as extended, the Tribunal might make a decision on his application without taking any further step to obtain his views.  He was also advised that he would lose any entitlement he might have otherwise had under the Act to appear before the Tribunal to give evidence and present arguments.  No response was received from the applicant.  In those circumstances, the Tribunal proceeded to make a decision on the review on the information available to it. The Tribunal found that the Barclays letter was a bogus document which the applicant had given, or caused to be given, to the Minister in relation to his visa application.  On that basis, it found that he did not satisfy PIC 4020(1).  It also found that as the applicant had not responded to its 18 November 2013 letter, there was no information before it to indicate that there were compelling or compassionate circumstances justifying the waiver of PIC 4020(1). Proceedings in this Court Application for extension of time  Section 477 of the Act provides the time limit which applies to proceedings for judicial review of Tribunal decisions in respect of which this Court has jurisdiction.  At the time the applicant commenced this proceeding, it relevantly provided:  477 Time limits on applications to the Federal Circuit Court  (1) An application to the Federal Circuit Court for a remedy to be granted in exercise of the court’s original jurisdiction under section 476 in relation to a migration decision must be made to the court within 35 days of the date of the migration decision.  (2) The Federal Circuit Court may, by order, extend that 35 day period as the Federal Circuit Court considers appropriate if:  (a) an application for that order has been made in writing to the Federal Circuit Court specifying why the applicant considers that it is necessary in the interests of the administration of justice to make the order; and  (b) the Federal Circuit Court is satisfied that it is necessary in the interests of the administration of justice to make the order.   (3) In this section:  date of the migration decision means:  ...  (b) in the case of a written migration decision made by the Migration Review Tribunal or the Refugee Review Tribunal—the date of the written statement under subsection 368(1) or 430(1); ... The Tribunal’s decision was dated 18 December 2013 which means that the applicant had until 22 January 2014 to commence these proceedings.  As the application was not filed until 29 January 2014, it was brought out of time. Application in writing citing reasons  The consequence of the application having been filed late is that the Court must consider the two questions posed by s.477(2).  The first of these is whether a written application has been made to the Court for an extension of time specifying why the applicant considers that it is necessary in the interests of the administration of justice that an order extending time to bring the proceedings be made.  In this case the applicant made an application in writing for an extension of time by including such a request in his application commencing these proceedings.  Further, his initiating application specified why he said it was in the interests of the administration of justice for time to be extended.  The initial criteria for the granting of an extension of time have therefore been satisfied.  Interests of the administration of justice  The second question posed by s.477(2) is whether it is in the interests of the administration of justice to extend the time for the filing of the application commencing these proceedings.  In the circumstances of this case, that question will be determined by whether the allegations made in the substantive application for judicial review have reasonable prospects of success and whether the applicant has provided a satisfactory explanation for the delay in commencing the proceedings. In his statement to the Court today from the bar table, the applicant said that he had not known that he had to lodge his application within thirty-five days of the Tribunal decision.  In his application commencing these proceedings, the applicant said that he had received information from the Department that he had until 30 January to file his application. I am prepared to accept that the applicant did not know that his application should have been filed within the thirty-five day period and I conclude that he has demonstrated a satisfactory explanation for the delay in commencing the proceedings. Reasonable prospects of success  In relation to the question of whether the substantive application has reasonable prospects of success, it should be noted that in proceedings for judicial review of a Tribunal decision the Court cannot reconsider the visa application underlying that decision.  Its task is to determine whether the relevant Tribunal decision is affected by jurisdictional error as that is the only basis upon which it can be set aside: s.474 of the Act; Plaintiff S157/2002 v Commonwealth (2003) 211 CLR 476.  Consequently, before the Court would conclude that it was in the interests of the administration of justice to extend the time within which to bring these proceedings, it was necessary that the applicant demonstrate that he had reasonable prospects of proving that the Tribunal’s decision on his visa application was affected by jurisdictional error.  I have concluded that he has not done so. In his application commencing this proceeding the applicant alleged:  1. MRT stated that they sent us a letter but I did not received any letter of invitation to appear for hearing.  I provided my contact number, email address and postal address as a source to contact.  But I did not received any piece of information required to appear for hearing.  And decision was made without my words being heared – No chance to provide evidence.  At the hearing of this application the applicant reinforced what he had said in his application by stating that he had not received the Tribunal’s invitation to respond to information and had wished to attend the Tribunal hearing in order to explain the circumstances of the letter on Barclays letterhead.  In essence, the applicant’s allegation was that he had been denied the real and meaningful hearing which s.360 of the Act implicitly guaranteed him. Another issue which arose in this matter was one which the Minister placed before the Court in the discharge of his duty as a model litigant.  That was whether the Tribunal was correct in concluding that the letter on the Barclays letterhead was bogus. Turning to the issue concerning s.360, the evidence relevant to this issue starts with the address given by the applicant to the Tribunal when applying for review of the delegate’s decision.  As reproduced at p.49 of the Court Book, which is exhibit A, the applicant provided an address in Auburn, a suburb of Sydney.  Reproduced at pp.68 to 71 of the Court Book is the letter which the Tribunal sent to the applicant, dated 18 November 2013, pursuant to s.359A of the Act.  The letter bears a registered post number on its first page. The next item of evidence relevant to the dispatch of the s.359A letter is the Australia Post document reproduced at pp.72 and 73 of the Court Book which, by reference to the same registered post number as appears on the first page of the s.359A letter, indicated that by 19 November 2013 the letter in question was at an Australia Post location in Villawood, pending delivery, which was attempted later in the day according to that document.  The significance of this document is, first, that the s.359A letter was sent by prepaid post to the applicant and, secondly, that it was so sent the day after the date which the letter bore.   The next evidence of relevance is found in para.3 of the Tribunal’s decision where the Tribunal records that the applicant did not respond to its letter.   I am satisfied that the notice requirements of s.359A and the delivery requirements of s.379A of the Act were satisfied.  That being so, the Tribunal was empowered by s.359C(2) to make a decision on the review without taking any further action to obtain the applicant’s views on the information.  Section 360 provides that, because s.359C(2) applied to the applicant, the Tribunal was not required by s.360(1) to invite the applicant to appear before it.  The Tribunal did not err by not inviting the applicant to appear before it and no breach of s.360 of the Act has been demonstrated. Turning to the issue of whether the Tribunal erred in considering whether the letter on the Barclays letterhead was bogus, it should be acknowledged that the Tribunal did not refer to the statements of law concerning what amounted to a bogus document, which the Full Court of the Federal Court made in Trivedi v Minister for Immigration & Border Protection [2014] FCAFC 42;  (2014) 220 FCR 169 and in Patel v Minister for Immigration & Border Protection  (2015) 145 ALD 566.  Nevertheless, it applied the correct test, namely, was the letter purportedly provided by Barclays Bank purposely untrue.  That it did so is made clear from paras.8 and 9 of its reasons. The applicant submitted to the Court that a fraud had been perpetrated upon him.  That may be true, but it does not mean that the Tribunal erred.  As Buchanan J said in Trivedi at 179 [49]:  ... it should be accepted that PIC 4020 is directed to information or documents which are purposely untrue. It seems to me to be clear from the same analysis that the purpose of PIC 4020 was to render visa applicants ultimately responsible for the veracity of the information and documents supplied to support the application. Although the limited terms of the waiver (and therefore any discretion to excuse non-compliance) make it apparent that innocent errors are not the focus of attention, it is equally clear that PIC 4020 is directed at the overall integrity of the visa system and as a bulwark against deception and fraud from any quarter associated with a visa applicant. It is not inconsistent with a coherent public policy to make a visa applicant ultimately responsible for purposely untrue material provided with a visa application. For these reasons, I conclude that the Tribunal did not err in finding that the letter purportedly from Barclays Bank was a bogus document or that the applicant failed to satisfy a requirement of PIC 4020 on that account.   Conclusion   Although the applicant has provided a satisfactory explanation for the delay in commencing the proceeding, his allegations of jurisdictional error do not have reasonable prospects of success.  Consequently, time for the bringing of the proceedings will not be extended and the application will be dismissed.I certify that the preceding thirty (30) paragraphs are a true copy of the reasons for judgment of Judge CameronAssociate:  Date: 27 August 2015       ',\n",
       " 'Arora v Minister for Immigration & Anor [2015] FCCA 2779 (8 October 2015)': '  This is an application within the Court’s jurisdiction under s.476 of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth), in which the applicant seeks a Constitutional writ in respect of the decision of the Tribunal, made on 1 May 2015, affirming a decision of the delegate not to grant the applicant a Skilled Residence (Class VB) visa.   On 20 January 2009, the applicant completed an application in support of the visa, in which he identified undertaking a skills assessment in respect of the nominated occupation of pastry cook, which it was said had been assessed by Trades Recognition Australia, dated 8 May 2008.  In the application that occupation provided a points score that was relevant to the making of the application.   In support of the application for a visa the applicant also provided to the Department the skills assessment by Trades Recognition Australia, dated 8 May 2008, in relation the occupation of pastry cook, which in its reasons referred to evidence provided by the applicant satisfying Trades Recognition Australia that the applicant had performed 900 hours directly related work experience, as set out in s.12 of the Uniform Assessment Criteria.  Part of the skills assessment set out an application assessment sheet that identified a positive answer in relation to the applicant having undertaken 900 hours work experience. It is clear that the applicant provided to Trade Recognition Australia an employment reference letter from Axilleon Cakes in Melbourne that purported to evidence 900 hours work experience by the applicant.  The delegate identified the criteria under cl.886.225 in relation to the mandatory requirements for the grant of the visa, as providing:  The applicant:  (a) satisfies public interest criteria 4001, 4002, 4003, 4004, 4010, and 4020; and   (b) if the applicant had turned 18 at the time of application – satisfies public interest criterion 4019 The delegate also identified the requirements of PIC4020 in Schedule 4 of the Regulations, which is as follows:  4020     (1)  There is no evidence before the Minister that the applicant has given, or caused to be given, to the Minister, an officer, the Tribunal during the review of a Part 5-reviewable decision, a relevant assessing authority or a Medical Officer of the Commonwealth, a bogus document or information that is false or misleading in a material particular in relation to:   (a)  the application for the visa; or   (b)  a visa that the applicant held in the period of 12 months before the application was made.   (2)  The Minister is satisfied that during the period:   (a)  starting 3 years before the application was made; and   (b)  ending when the Minister makes a decision to grant or refuse to grant the visa;  the applicant and each member of the family unit of the applicant has not been refused a visa because of a failure to satisfy the criteria in subclause (1).   (2A)  The applicant satisfies the Minister as to the applicant\\'s identity.   (2B)  The Minister is satisfied that during the period:   (a)  starting 10 years before the application was made; and   (b)  ending when the Minister makes a decision to grant or refuse to grant the visa;  neither the applicant, nor any member of the family unit of the applicant, has been refused a visa because of a failure to satisfy the criteria in subclause (2A).   (3)  To avoid doubt, subclauses (1) and (2) apply whether or not the Minister became aware of the bogus document or information that is false or misleading in a material particular because of information given by the applicant.   (4)  The Minister may waive the requirements of any or all of paragraphs (1)(a) or (b) and subclause (2) if satisfied that:   (a)  compelling circumstances that affect the interests of Australia; or   (b)  compassionate or compelling circumstances that affect the interests of an Australian citizen, an Australian permanent resident or an eligible New Zealand citizen;  justify the granting of the visa.   (5)  In this clause:  \" information that is false or misleading in a material particular \" means information that is:   (a)  false or misleading at the time it is given; and   (b)  relevant to any of the criteria the Minister may consider when making a decision on an application, whether or not the decision is made because of that information. The delegate referred to the definition of bogus document at the time that was then in the Regulations and picked up s.97, which in substance was the definition found at the time of determination by the Tribunal in s.5(1) as follows:  \"bogus document \" , in relation to a person, means a document that the Minister reasonably suspects is a document that:   (a)  purports to have been, but was not, issued in respect of the person; or   (b)  is counterfeit or has been altered by a person who does not have authority to do so; or   (c)  was obtained because of a false or misleading statement, whether or not made knowingly. The delegate relevantly found:  On 20 January 2009 you lodged your application for a Skilled - (VB 886) Sponsored (Full Fee) visa .  On 21 January 2009, in support of your application for a Skilled - (VB 886) Sponsored (Full Fee) visa, you provided to an officer a skills assessment from Trades Recognition Australia (TRA) - Reference Number: TRAOS/062209744. To obtain this skills assessment, you supplied to TRA documents supporting your 900 hours work experience from Axilleon Cakes.  ...  The documents you provided to TRA in support of your claimed 900 hours work experience are from Axilleon Cakes. The individual\\'s admissions and subsequent guilty plea to the design, production and sale of work references from Axilleon Cakes.to assist GSM visa applicants to obtain positive skills assessments therefore give rise to a very strong inference that the supporting documents you provided to TRA are also fraudulent.  In my assessment, you have failed to provide sufficient evidence, including the provision of any independently verifiable third paity documents, to substantiate your employment claims.   Based on the evidence and information before me, I am satisfied that the skills assessment with the reference number TRAOS/062209744 you submitted to an officer of the department on 21 January 2009 is a bogus document within the meaning of subsection 97( c) of the Act because I reasonably suspect it is a document that was obtained because of a false or misleading statement made to TRA, whether or not made knowingly, about your claimed 900 hours work experience from Axilleon Cakes.  As there is evidence that you have given, or caused to be given, a bogus document in relation to your visa application to an officer, I find that you do not satisfy PIC 4020(1). In summary, the applicant contended that Trades Recognition Australia was not an authorised assessor at the times of the skills assessment and, therefore, the document was not relevant to PIC4020(1).  The Tribunal identified the purpose of PIC4020 and referred to the decision in Batra v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2013] FCA 274, and distinguished the decisions of Sharma v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2014] FCCA 2821 and Singh v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship & Anor [2012] FMCA 145 and relevantly held:  79. Consequently, given the case law in the Batra appeal case and Mudiyanselage \\'s case, as well as the decisions in Sharma \\'s case and MRT Case No. 1217622, the Tribunal does not accept the representative\\'s submission that the status of Trades Recognition Australia when it issued the applicant with a favourable skills assessment in May 2008 prevents the application of public interest criterion 4020 to him in circumstances where it is alleged that he gave a bogus document to the Minister with his visa application.  ...  97. The Tribunal further observes that the question posed by subclause 4020(1) requires it to make a \"no evidence\" finding regarding the matters set out in this provision. As a result, even if the Tribunal accepted that the applicant did undertake some work experience as a pastry cook at Axilleon Cakes, the evidence in this case casts serious doubt upon the nature and duration of that claimed work experience and whether he actually completed the 900 hours\\' work experience required for a valid skills assessment to be issued by Trades Recognition Australia in 2008.  98. Accordingly, whilst the Tribunal has had regard to the applicant\\'s responses to the Department in November 2011 and October 2012, as well as to the Tribunal in 2015, it considers that the information before it does raise serious doubts about the duration of the applicant\\'s claimed work experience at Axilleon Cakes. Therefore, the Tribunal is satisfied that this information casts doubt on the applicant\\'s claim that he undertook more than 1000 hours work experience at Axilleon Cakes in 2007 /08.  99. As a result, and having regard to the relevant case law, the Tribunal considers that the facts conveyed by the information before it constitute \"evidence\" that casts serious doubt as to whether the applicant had actually completed 900 hours\\' work experience at Axilleon Cakes, as required by Trades Recognition Australia in 2007/08.   100. As noted above, the skills assessment issued to the applicant was based on the evidence he had provided to Trades Recognition Australia that purportedly satisfied the UAC requirement for 900 hours directly related work experience as a pastry cook.  101. Consequently, the Tribunal finds that the information before it, taken as a whole, constitutes evidence of the applicant having provided a false or misleading statement to Trades Recognition Australia regarding the number of hours work experience he had undertaken at Axilleon Cakes in 2007/08. This information then resulted in the favourable skills assessment issued to the applicant.  102. Therefore, the Tribunal finds that there is evidence that gives rise to a reasonable suspicion that the skills assessment issued to the applicant was obtained because of a false or misleading statement and, therefore, a \\'bogus document\\' as defined in subsection 5(1 )( c) of the Act.  103. The applicant has not disputed the fact that he provided his skills assessment from Trades Recognition Australia to the Department for the purposes of his subclass 886 visa application.  ...  107. In the present matter, in the Tribunal\\'s view the evidence regarding Mr A\\'s criminal conviction, and the fact that Mr A specifically identified the applicant as a person for whom he had signed a work reference in Ms X\\'s name with her consent, coupled with the applicant\\'s admission that he had paid Mr A $250 for a work reference, is sufficient to satisfy the requirement in Trivedi \\'s case for there to be an element of fraud or deception on the part of someone, if not the applicant.  108. The Tribunal further observes that there is ample judicial authority to the effect that an applicant\\'s indifference to the details set out in a visa application, including where the details are provided by a third party agent rather than the applicant personally, does not mean that the applicant can avoid the application of public interest criterion 4020. 59  109. Consequently, having regard to the evidence before it and the relevant case law, given that the applicant submitted his favourable skills assessment from Trades Recognition Australia to the Department (the Minister) with his visa application, the Tribunal is not persuaded that the circumstances envisaged in Trivedi\\'s case60 in relation to innocent, unintended or accidental matters, apply in the present review application.  110. Therefore, the Tribunal finds that the applicant gave, or caused to be given, a \\'bogus document\\' when the subclass 886 visa application was lodged on 20 January 2009.  Summation:  111. Consequently, for the purposes of subclause 4020(1 ), the Tribunal considers that the information before it constitutes evidence that the applicant gave, or caused to be given, a \\'bogus document\\', as defined by subsection 5( 1) of the Act, to the Minister or an officer when he submitted his skills assessment to the Department with his visa application.  112. As a result, the Tribunal is not satisfied that there is no evidence that the applicant has given, or caused to be given, to the Minister, or an officer of the Department, a \\'bogus document\\' in relation to his application for a Skilled (Residence) (Class VB) visa. Accordingly, the Tribunal finds that the applicant does not meet the requirements of paragraph 4020(1)(a) and subclause 4020(1 ). The Tribunal then turned to the issue of compassionate or compelling circumstances and noted that this was a case where the applicant had instructed the Tribunal to determine the matter on the papers, and it was in those circumstances.  The Tribunal concluded  146. As a result, the Tribunal finds that the applicant does not satisfy paragraphs 4020(4)(a) and (b) and subclause 4020( 4) at the time of its decision. Therefore, given its earlier finding in relation to subclause 4020(1 ), the Tribunal also finds that the applicant does not satisfy the requirements of public interest criterion 4020 at the time of its decision.  147. Consequently, the Tribunal finds that the applicant does not meet the requirements of subclause 886.225(a) and clause 886.225 at the time of decision and the visa application fails on this basis.  148. In order to meet the criteria for a Subclass 885 (Skilled - Independent) visa and Subclass 887 (Skilled - Regional) visa, the Tribunal observes that the applicant must meet clauses 885.224 and 887.225 respectively at the time of its decision. Clauses 885.224 and 887.225 are drafted in similar terms to clause 886.225, and they also require the applicant to meet public interest criterion 4020.  149. Accordingly, for the reasons set out above in relation to public interest criterion 4020 and clause 886.225, the Tribunal also finds that the applicant does not satisfy clauses 885.224 and 887.225 at the time of its decision. Consequently, the visa application also fails on this basis. The grounds of the amended application are as follows:  1. The Second Respondent, the Migration Review Tribunal (\"the tribunal\") fell into jurisdictional error by finding that the Public Interest Criterion (PIC) 4020 was enlivened in the current case.  Particulars  (a) It was not open to the Tribunal to find that the Applicant in the first instance application (Visa subclass 886) was required, at the time of application to evidence a skills assessment. At the time of the making of the application [ 20 January 2009] the requirement for a skills assessment at cl.886.223( 1) of Schedule 2 to the Migration Regulations 1994 (\"the Regulations\") was, by reason of the failure to appoint TRA as the relevant skills assessing authority, had the effect of rendering the regulation invalid as it was incapable of being met. That being the case, there was no requirement at the time of the making of the application for a valid skills assessment thus rendering any purported skills assessment at the time of the making of the application not material to the visa subclass.  (b) It is a requirement of PIC 4020 that the relevant info1mation be false or misleading in a material particular [cl.4020 (5)] of the Regulations] The Tribunal erred in finding that a valid skills assessment was a requirement at the time of making the application.  2. The Second Respondent in hearing the matter de novo and in making a decision absent the Applicant\\'s oral evidence fell into jurisdictional error by making a finding that PIC4020 (1) was enlivened by reason of the giving of false evidence which was either in the form of a bogus document or was false and misleading in a material particular by reason of the material before it.  Particulars  (a) The finding of the Tribunal that the admission of \"A\" (paragraphs 7 and 107 of the decision record) to the effect that A had signed the work reference for and on behalf of Ms X with her consent, did not render that work reference a bogus document nor did the admission by the Applicant that he had paid \"A\" $250 to prepare the reference. Thus the giving of the requisite consent by the person purporting to make the work reference does not constitute a false or misleading statement in a material particular. (b)The finding of the Tribunal that criterion 886.225(a) of the Regulations applied at the time of decision [30 October 2014] arises by reason of the importing into the statutory scheme on 2 April of 2011, through criterion 886.225(a), the requirement that the Applicant meet the requirements of PIC 4020 at the date of the decision. The TRA was not validly appointed untill October 2011.[IMMI 11/068; SLIF2011L02011] It follows therefore that at the time of decision, the incorporation of criterion 886.225(a) had the effect of requiring the applicant not to give or cause to be given a bogus document or information that is false and misleading in a material particular; could not be made out because criterion 886.223(1) was a time of application and not a time of decision criterion. Thus the purported skills assessment was not material to any statutory requirement other than cl 886.225(a) which imported PIC 4020 into the statutory scheme.  Thus, the reception of evidence and the elucidation of facts and the making of findings in respect of those matters [the skills assessment] was misconceived by reason of it not being material to the task of the Tribunal was required to undertake in respect of the satisfaction of criterion 886.223(1) and could not inform the decision of the Tribunal to the extent asserted. The Tribunal erred by applying the wrong test. I note that there was an alternative further ground that was abandoned by counsel for the applicant.  I note that counsel for the applicant was, in my opinion, entirely correct in abandoning the alternative ground in relation to s.359A.  In relation to grounds 1 and 2, it was accepted that these were, in substance, the same grounds 1 and 2 as advanced in the matter of Singh. The Tribunal was correct to find that the PIC4020 criterion was enlivened and had application to the bogus document dated 8 May 2008 provided by the applicant to the Department. There is no substance in the contention that the Tribunal applied the wrong test. The unauthorised assessor status of the TRA in the letter dated 8 May 2008 was a bogus document in relation to the application for the visa. For the reasons given in the matter of Singh, grounds 1 and 2 fail to make out any jurisdictional error.I certify that the preceding twelve (12) paragraphs are a true copy of the reasons for judgment of Judge StreetAssociate:  Date:  19 October 2015       ',\n",
       " 'Aulakh v Minister for Immigration & Anor [2015] FCCA 2290 (24 August 2015)': '  This is an application for a Constitutional writ within the Court’s jurisdiction at s.476 of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) in respect of a decision of the Tribunal made on 24 April 2015 affirming a decision of the delegate not to grant the applicant a Regional Employer Nomination (Permanent) Class RN visa.  The applicant is a citizen of India who applied for a said visa on 7 November 2013.  On 20 March 2014 the delegate wrote to the applicant and informed the applicant action required:  Action Required  The nomination submitted to the Department by SAHIL NEELA PTY LTD (TRN EGO48FMOO8) lodged on 07/11/2013, was refused on 20/03/2014. Unfortunately this means that your visa application cannot be approved. There are two options you can now take in relation to this decision: That information conveyed to the applicant that the criteria for meeting the applicant could not be met.  It was in those circumstances that the delegate on 6 June 2014 made an adverse determination in relation to the applicant on the grounds that the criteria under cl.187.233 had not been met.  The particular delegate set out the relevant provision at court book 42.  The applicant was invited to attend a hearing by a letter dated 4 February 2015, which hearing took place on 12 March.  The applicant was represented by a migration agent. The Tribunal noted:  9. For applicants in the Direct Entry stream, cl.187.233 requires that the position to which the application relates be the subject of an application for approval of a nominated position under r.5.19(4)(h)(ii) of the Regulations (that is, a Direct Entry nomination in regional Australia), or under r.5.19(4) as it was prior to 1 July 2012 (that is, a Regional Sponsored Migration Scheme nomination). The position must be the one that was the subject of the declaration that was required to be made as part of the current visa application.  10. In addition, this criterion also requires that:  • the person who will employ the applicant was the nominator in the application for approval  • the nomination has been approved and has not been subsequently withdrawn  • the position is still available to the applicant, and  • the visa application was made no more than six months after the nomination of the position was approved. It was in those circumstances where the Tribunal noted that the Tribunal affirmed the decision to refuse the related nomination, and hence the criteria under cl.187.233 was not met.  It was in those circumstances the Tribunal said:  12. The applicant has only sought to satisfy the criteria for a Subclass 187 visa in the Direct Entry stream. No claims have been made in respect of the other visa streams. As the requirements that must be met by a person seeking the visa in the Direct Entry stream have not been met, the decision under review must be affirmed. The application identifies the following grounds:  1. Failed to take into account relevant consideration.   2. Took into account of irrelevant information as key part of the decision.  There is no relevant consideration is articulated or particularised. The reasons given for the Tribunal are clear and there is not substance in relation to ground 1 of the application.  To the extent that ground 2 asserts the taking into account of irrelevant information, no information said to be irrelevant is identified, and ground 2 fails to make out any jurisdictional error. The applicant from the bar table submitted that he had been unable to get a lawyer and that he had been told that there is no jurisdictional error disclosed in his application, and that was a problem that he faced in trying to get assistance.  The Court provided the applicant with the opportunity to discontinue the proceedings if he saw fit, albeit that the cost consequence was of a small if any difference in relation to that course.  Nothing said by the applicant or in the application discloses any arguable jurisdictional error.  The application is dismissed.I certify that the preceding seven (7) paragraphs are a true copy of the reasons for judgment of Judge StreetAssociate:  Date:  31 August 2015       ',\n",
       " 'BBI15 v Minister for Immigration & Anor [2015] FCCA 3047 (13 November 2015)': \"  This is an application within the Court’s jurisdiction under s.476 of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) in respect of a decision the Tribunal made on 25 May 2015 affirming the decision of the delegate not to grant the applicant a protection visa. The applicant was found to be a citizen of India and his claims were assessed against that country.  The applicant was issued with a valid passport on 15 October 2009 which, on its face, remained valid until 14 October 2019.  The applicant arrived in Melbourne Australia on 13 October 2013 as a holder of a business visitor visa, subclass 600, granted on 16 August 2013 which was valid until 13 January 2014.  The applicant applied for protection on 27 November 2013. The applicant claimed a fear of harm being a Hindu and an active member of the Bharatiya Janta Part (the BJP) and the Student Federation Akhil Bharatiya Vikdyharthi Parishad (ABVP) and claimed to fear harm in India from Muslim extremists and members of the Muslim community due his religious and political involvement and claimed he had been attacked and threatened by Muslim extremists in the past and as a result of his membership of the BJP and ABVP. The Tribunal did not accept the applicant’s evidence as credible and gave logical reasons to support that finding.  Those reasons cannot be said to lack an evident and intelligible justification.  The reasons include a reference to a document to which the Tribunal decided to give no weight and relevantly said:  29. The document claiming that he was the Vice President of Youth Wing of “Bharathiya Janatha Yuva Morcha Nileshwar Municipal Committee since 2009, is dated 4 October 2013.  On its face, the document is claiming that he held that position for about four years from 2009 and is not consistent with the applicant’s claims that he held the position for 18 months in 2008-2009. He specifically said that after 2011 he was busy with work and his family said to look after his family and his work first.  The Tribunal does not accept his explanation for the inconsistency between the document and his evidence, that is, that he continued to hold the position but was not active.  30. Further, on the letterhead of the document and in its body, “Janata” is mis-spelt. That is inconsistent with the document being genuine.  It is also the same mis-spelling that appears in his statement that accompanied his visa application.  The Tribunal accepts the applicant’s evidence that he prepared his visa application without assistance.  31. The Tribunal gives the document no weight.   32. The Tribunal does not accept the applicant’s claims at the hearing to have kept to himself or to have hidden in Mysore and Chennai, that he was attacked but escaped in Mysore and that it also happened in Bangalore where he had gone for training related to his work.  That was the first time he had mentioned Bangalore at all.  He had made no claims about anything happening in Mysore before, including at the departmental interview, as reflected in the summary in the delegate’s decision provided to the Tribunal.   33. He claimed at the hearing that he had changed rooms with friends and did not tell anyone where he worked in Chennai, that people had come to his old house and he had run away.  His claim in his visa application about fundamentalist leaders sending a gangster to kill him, being cruelly attacked and left in the bush, and spending 10 days in hospital is inconsistent with his claims at the hearing The Tribunal does not accept that he would have forgotten to mention an incident which resulted in his spending ten days in hospital.  34. For those reasons, the Tribunal does not accept the applicant’s claims about his membership of any political group in India or his involvement in political activities in India or that he has been threatened or harmed for those reasons or because of his or his family’s religion or religious or political activities, by Moslem fundamentalists, MSF, criminals or anyone else, in India.  It does not accept that he has been threatened in Australia or lost jobs because of claims made to his employers that he is working for the BJP or because of his religious or political affiliation or activities. It does not accept that he will be involved in any political or religious activities in India if he returns or will be harmed because of his religion or perceived political opinion if he returns to India.  It does not accept that any member of his family has been threatened or harmed because of his or their actual or perceived political or religious affiliation or activities.  35. Because the Tribunal does not accept that the applicant’s evidence is credible, and does not accept his claims about his or his family’s political or religious activities or his or their perceived political or religious affiliations  or the consequences of those activities or perceived affiliations in the past or in the future, it does not accept that there is a real chance that the applicant will suffer serious harm or that there is a real risk that the applicant will suffer significant harm, if he returns to India because of his or his family’s religion or  actual or perceived political affiliation or activities.  36. The Tribunal is not satisfied that there is a real chance that the applicant will suffer serious harm in the reasonably foreseeable future for a Convention reason if he returns to India.   37. The Tribunal is not satisfied that the applicant is a person in respect of whom Australia has protection obligations under the Refugees Convention. Therefore the applicant does not satisfy the criterion set out in s.36(2)(a).  38. Having concluded that the applicant does not meet the refugee criterion in s.36(2)(a), the Tribunal has considered the alternative criterion in s.36(2)(aa).   39. For the above reasons, the Tribunal is not satisfied that there are substantial grounds for believing that, as a necessary and foreseeable consequence of the applicant's being removed from Australia to India, there is a real risk that he will suffer significant harm. That finding by the Tribunal as to the weight to be given to the document was a matter for the Tribunal and the reasoning identifies no logical or rational error. Relevantly, the Tribunal did not accept the applicant’s evidence as being credible and rejected his claims about his or his family’s political/religious activities.  The Tribunal rejected the alleged political/religious affiliations or the consequences of those activities or perceived affiliations in the past or in the future. The Tribunal did not accept that there is a real chance the applicant will suffer serious harm or that there is a real risk the applicant will suffer significant harm if he returns to India because of his or his family’s religion or actual perceived political affiliation or activities. The Tribunal made express findings rejecting the applicant’s claims in this regard in para.34. It was in those circumstances that the Tribunal found that the applicant was not a person in respect of whom Australia had a protection obligation and that the criteria under ss.36(2)(a) and 36(2)(aa) was not satisfied. On 13 July 2015, a Registrar of this Court made orders fixing the matter for a show cause hearing under r.44.12 of the Federal Circuit Court Rules 2001 and also provided an opportunity for the applicant to file an amended application, affidavit evidence or submissions.  No such documents were filed. The grounds of the application are as follows:  1. The second respondent failed to comply with the mandatory requirement under section 424A(read with section 424AA) of the Migration Act to give the applicant clear particulars of information it considered would be part of the reason for affirming the decision under review, to ensure the applicant understood why that information was relevant to the review and the consequence of its being relied upon, and to invite the applicant to comment upon or respond to that information.  Particular:  The Tribunal did not issue any written invitation under section 424A of the Act and, made no attempt to, and did not, comply with the requirements set out in section 424AA of the Act.  2. The Tribunal constructively failed to exercise its jurisdiction;  Particular:  The applicant provided membership certificate to the delegate to corroborate his claims. The delegate and Tribunal ultimately gave the document no weight on the basis of credit findings. It was an error for the Tribunal to place no weight on the documents without engaging to the contents of these documents. It was an error for the Tribunal to assess the applicant's credit without first assessing whether the substance of the document corroborated his claim.  3. The Tribunal's decision was unjust and made without taking in to account the full gravity of Applicant's circumstances and consequences of claims. The Tribunal did not consider the applicant who had been under immense and intimidating pressure from Muslim extremists. In relation to the first ground, no information to enliven an obligation under s.424A is identified and it is clear from the Tribunal’s reasons that it was on grounds of credibility in relation to the applicant’s evidence that the decision under review was affirmed. I accept the first respondent’s submission that there is no information identified capable of enlivening any obligation under s.424A or any ground on which the Tribunal was required to meet the requirements of s.424AA of the Act.  I accept the first respondent’s submission that ground 1 fails to disclose any arguable jurisdictional error. In relation to ground 2, it is clear that the Tribunal identified the applicant’s claims and made findings on those claims, taking into account the applicant’s evidence.  It was a matter for the Tribunal whether or not to accept the evidence and documents provided by the applicant and the reference to the membership certificate that was referred in paras.29 and 30, quoted above, to which the Tribunal gave no weight, does not identify any arguable case of a constructive failure of the Tribunal to exercise its jurisdiction.  Further, it was a matter for the Tribunal to determine the applicant’s credit.  I accept the first respondent’s submission that ground 2 fails to identify any arguable jurisdictional error. In relation to ground 3, it is clear that the applicant was invited, by letter dated 16 March 2015, to attend a hearing on 20 May 2015 and that the applicant did attend that hearing to give evidence and present arguments and was assisted by an interpreter.  It was a matter for the Tribunal to evaluate the applicant’s claims and make findings in that regard and it is clear that the Tribunal took into account, as part of the applicant’s claims, his alleged fear of Muslim extremists which were the subject of adverse findings in paras.34 and 35. Accordingly, there is no substance in the proposition that the Tribunal’s decision was unjust or was made without taking into account the applicant’s evidence and submissions.  I accept the first respondent’s submission that ground 3 fails to disclose any arguable jurisdictional error. The applicant raised, from the bar table, the document referred to in paras.29 and 30 above which, for the reasons given, it was open to the Tribunal to determine to give that document no weight.  Nothing said by the applicant from the bar table identified any arguable jurisdictional error. The application fails to disclose any arguable case. I am satisfied that this is an appropriate matter in which to exercise the Court’s powers under r.44.12 of the Federal Circuit Court Rules 2001. The application is dismissed under r.44.12 of the Federal Circuit Court Rules 2001.I certify that the preceding sixteen (16) paragraphs are a true copy of the reasons for judgment of Judge StreetAssociate: Date:  25 November 2015       \",\n",
       " 'BCO15 v Minister for Immigration & Anor [2015] FCCA 2613 (23 September 2015)': \"  This is an application for a Constitutional writ within the Court’s jurisdiction under s.476 of the Migration Act 1958 in respect of a decision of the Tribunal made on 29 May 2015 affirming a decision of the delegate not to grant the applicant a protection visa.  The applicant was found to be a citizen of Sri Lanka and his claims were assessed against that country as the receiving country.   The applicant claimed that he had a well-founded fear of convention-related persecution because of his membership of the Karuna group or other groups, because of his Tamil ethnicity, place of origin, imputed as pro-LTTE or anti-government profile because of his ethnicity, illegal departure from Sri Lanka and application for asylum in Australia and as a failed asylum seeker and in relation to his ability to return to his home area. The Court made orders on 30 July 2015 fixing the matter for hearing and providing an opportunity to file an amended application, further affidavits and submissions by the applicant.  No such documents were filed.  The grounds of the application are as follows:  1. The RRT erred in law, and the error is a jurisdictional error, in misapplying the well-founded fear test.  Particulars  The Tribunal failed to find a Convention nexus that the Applicant belonged to a particular social group of young Tamil Males from the north and east and therefore will face persecution on return to Sri Lanka.  The Tribunal failed to find that the Applicant will face persecution as he has been imputed with the LTTE political opinion. In support of the applicant’s application and in answer to the first respondent’s submissions, the applicant identified the circumstances in which he left India and returned to Sri Lanka.  The applicant also identified that he had a family member who had been involved in the LTTE in relation to his fear of returning to Sri Lanka.  The applicant also made reference to a letter that was written by his cousin who he had described as his elder brother and who was now living in London which had been provided to the Tribunal. This was a case where the Tribunal made adverse findings in relation to the applicant’s credit.  The Tribunal identified the applicant’s claims and did not accept that the applicant had a well-founded fear of persecution.  Relevantly, in paras.7 and 8 as follows:7. The Tribunal has considered express, implied and possible claims arising on the evidence made by the applicant, sourced from his statement, his agent on his behalf in oral/written submissions, his documentary evidence provided. as well as from his earlier interviews. These are referred to below. By way of background, the Tribunal notes that his main claims related to harm feared as a result of his time spent in India and subsequent treatment in Sri Lanka as a former refugee from India; targeting by the authorities, Karuna Group and greasemen upon return to Sri Lanka from India; and later he claimed to fear harm due to his relationship to, and time spent with, a cousin involved with the LTTE, as well as fears relating to his illegal departure from Sri Lanka and his current travel to Australia, and his return to [Y].   8. For the reasons set out below, the Tribunal does not accept that the applicant has a well-founded fear of persecution for a Convention reason, nor that there are substantial grounds for believing that as a necessary and foreseeable consequence of the applicant being removed from Australia to Sri Lanka, there is a real risk that he will suffer significant harm. The Tribunal has accordingly affirmed the decision of the delegate to refuse to grant the applicant a Protection visa. The Tribunal proceeded to set out in detail the claims and evidence of the applicant. The Tribunal summarised the relevant law within annexure A referred to in para.2 of the reasons which correctly identified the principles relating to a well-founded fear of persecution as well as identifying the PAM3 Ministerial Direction. There was an express reference to the taking into account of that PAM3 in para.169 in the second dot point. The applicant was invited to attend a hearing consistent with the statutory regime which was postponed at the request of the applicant’s representative until 24 April 2015. The applicant attended on that date to give evidence and present arguments. Written submissions dated 9 April 2015 had been provided to the Tribunal prior to the hearing and after the hearing further submissions were provided dated 1 May 2015.   The Tribunal relevantly said:  40. Having considered the relevant evidence, the Tribunal has serious concerns about the applicant's credibility and the veracity of his claims. The Tribunal does not accept that the applicant is a witness of truth concerning matters central to, and related to, his claims of past persecution, his reasons for travelling to Australia, and his future fears. The Tribunal has made the adverse credibility finding for the reasons set out below. The Tribunal then set out detailed reasons in relation to the applicant’s claims in relation to his cousin and the LTTE and made adverse findings which were clearly open on the material before the Tribunal.  The Tribunal turned to the issue of the applicant returning to Sri Lanka from India and the alleged incidents that were alleged to have occurred in June 2012.  Relevantly the Tribunal held:   64. The Tribunal is not satisfied with the applicant's explanations, and it considers his return from India to Sri Lanka indicates that he had not previously suffered significantly, nor did he believe that he would suffer upon return. The Tribunal does not accept that the applicant's family would not have known, or would not have informed him about the situation in his home area before his return. The Tribunal considers this undermines his claims that the situation was difficult for young Tamil males such as himself returning from India in 2010.  ...  66. ... The ·Tribunal considers the applicant's changing evidence undermines his credibility and his claims that the army attacked him and his friend in June 2012.  ...  67. ... The Tribunal also considers the applicant's changing evidence to be inconsistent with his statement, where he claimed to have remained at home for about 1 week or so after the incident, then he left for Australia. It is also inconsistent with his claim, as set out in the delegate's decision record that he resided in the same residence from birth till departure for Australia other than when he resided in India.  68. The applicant told the Tribunal that his fear when he returns is that the authorities will arrest him and take him to the fourth floor of the CID because his cousin was with the LTTE and the applicant went to India with him, and they want to get information about his cousin, or to take revenge on the applicant in place of the cousin. However, the Tribunal considered that the claimed actions of the authorities were inconsistent with the claims that they were genuinely interested in obtaining information from the applicant (about his cousin or any other matter). or in banning the applicant for the reasons set out below:  ...  73. ...The Tribunal has considered this submission, however in light of its significant concerns about the applicant’s claims relating to his cousin, it is not prepared to accept that this supports the applicant's claims. In any event, the Tribunal notes that not only did the applicant return, he remained in Sri Lanka for almost 2 years, which as indicated above provided the authorities with sufficient time to show any interest in him.  74. The Tribunal was concerned about the applicant's non-credible and changing evidence relating to being targeted by the Karuna group.  ...  77. The Tribunal notes that the applicant originally said that his former friend was looking for him form 2010 to 2012 to harm him. The Tribunal considers the applicant’s changing evidence in response to its concerns undermines the applicant’s credibility. and his claim that a former friend from the Karuna group was looking for him to harm him.  New claim that his friend Karen's brother was involved in the LTTE  78. According to the applicant's statement, the incident of June 2012 occurred with his friend Karen. Karen’s name had been called out, and then they had both been knocked off their bikes, and were assaulted. In the delegate’s interview (as set out in the delegate's decision record), the applicant claimed for the first time that Karen's brother was LTTE. When the delegate put to the applicant that this had not been raised before, the applicant's response was that no one had asked him. Noting that this is the incident the applicant claimed made him leave Sri Lanka for the second time, the Tribunal considers his failure to mention this LTTE connection prior to the delegate's interview undermines his claim that he has a friend Karen's whose brother's was connected with the LTTE.  79. The Tribunal’s concerns were heightened because at hearing, the applicant made no mention that Karen's brother was LTTE, despite being asked whether there was anything further he had not mentioned to the Tribunal in his evidence. When the Tribunal later raised this matter, and asked the applicant why he did not mention it, he said this was because he had not been asked. The Tribunal considers that if Karen's brother was LTTE the applicant would have mentioned this to the Tribunal.  80. On the basis of the above, the Tribunal is not satisfied that the applicant is a witness of truth. The Tribunal noted the post-hearing submissions in relation to the experiences to which the applicant had been exposed in relation to assessing his credibility and, relevantly, the Tribunal found:  83. ... However, the Tribunal is not persuaded that these matters can overcome the difficulties with the applicant’s evidence as referred to above. The Tribunal identified the applicant’s provision of a statement from a person claiming to be the applicant’s cousin which the Tribunal analysed in some detail and relevantly found:  86. The Tribunal considers that the statement from the claimed cousin is a mere assertion from an unknown person. The Tribunal put to the applicant at hearing that documents could be provided by anyone; in the circumstances, including a lack of any identity or supporting documents or explanation as to why these have not been provided to the Tribunal, concerning this claim which is said to be so important, the Tribunal is not prepared to give the post-hearing statement or information about the claimed cousin any weight.  87. It was submitted by the agent that the applicant's association with his cousin would place the applicant at risk of harm upon return to Sri Lanka, and that although there may be concerns with aspects of the applicant's evidence, this does not mean that all claims or evidence should be rejected, as a portion could be accepted. The Tribunal has considered this submission, however it does not accept that the correspondence supports that the applicant has a cousin with whom he lived in India who was involved with the LTTE and has been granted refugee status in the UK.  Credibility summary  88. Considered cumulatively, the concerns the Tribunal holds about the applicant's credibility as discussed above lead the Tribunal to conclude that the applicant is not a witness of truth and the applicant has exaggerated and fabricated accounts of events, as well as claimed fears, upon which he has based his protection claims. It was in these circumstances the Tribunal found:  90. On the basis of the adverse credibility finding and its rejection of the documents produced from London as containing true information, the Tribunal does not accept that the applicant had a cousin who was involved in the LTTE, nor that the applicant, his cousin (or any other relative) was suspected of being involved in the LTTE. The Tribunal does not accept any claimed events or suspicion occurred because of a relative's involvement with the LTTE. The applicant also does not accept that he had a friend whose brother was involved with the LTTE.  ...  96. The Tribunal finds that the Sri Lankan authorities were aware of the applicant's return to Sri Lanka from India, that they were aware he had fled to India during the conflict, and that he had been recognised as a refugee there, and that the applicant chose to return home, as did many other Ta1nils from India after the conflict. The Tribunal finds that the applicant was of no interest to the Sri Lankan authorities for any reason upon his return to Sri Lanka from India, nor was he imputed with an LTTE profile because he was in India. This is consistent with the country information set out in the delegate's decision record provided to the Tribunal by the applicant; namely that (as at 2012) the Sri Lankan government actively concentrated on a massive resettlement and development drive to encourage and assist returnees from India. Both the Sri Lankan government and UNHCR have assisted and continue to assist voluntary repatriations. Returns from India are voluntary as India does not return Sri Lankan refugees involuntarily. Tamils in India comprise the largest refugee group in camps globally. Both the governments of India and Sri Lanka do not consider such persons as having LTTE links as a matter of course (although that is not to discount that some refugees in India may have been former LTTE members or were associated with the LTTE). Both Sri Lanka and India have come to understand that the diaspora in Tamil Nadu is a Tamil problem where people took refuge fleeing attacks .... and not an LTTE problem. There is no evidence of a presumption of LTTE engagement attached to persons who have been Sri Lankan Tamil refugees in India as some time or other. Some of the largest numbers of returnees have been back to [Y].  97. The Tribunal has considered whether the applicant faced any difficulties upon his return from India.  ...  101. On the basis of the adverse credibility finding, the Tribunal does not accept that the applicant had any encounters or incidents with the authorities after his return to Sri Lanka from India; and specifically, the Tribunal does not accept that the event of 18 June 2012 occurred, nor that there was an increased presence of authorities in his area thereafter.  The Karuna Group  102. On the basis of the adverse credibility finding, the Tribunal does not accept that he was searched for, summonsed, threatened by. or feared harm at the hands of, anyone in the Karuna group.  103. ... The Tribunal has not accepted that the applicant had any adverse encounter with the authorities nor with anyone else or groups (such as Karuna or greasemen) in Sri Lanka, after he returned from India. It is further not prepared to accept that he became of adverse interest to the authorities or anyone else at any time while he was in Sri Lanka.  ...  105. ...The Tribunal does not accept that the applicant suffered harm (in the form of discrimination or otherwise) upon return to Sri Lanka from India.  ...  107. The Tribunal does not accept that the applicant fled Sri Lanka for Australia in fear of his life or because he was in danger or because he was targeted for harm by anyone, any groups, or any authorities. The Tribunal has considered the agent's submission that his family may not have told him about people looking for him, so there could have been more instances than that referred to by the applicant; however the Tribunal does not accept that anyone has had any adverse interest in the applicant while he was in Sri Lanka, or since he left Sri Lanka. In relation to the applicant’s feared harm, upon return to Sri Lanka, the Tribunal held:  108. In the oral/written submissions, it was claimed that the applicant would suffer harm not only for reason of his ethnicity being Tamil, but also because of his imputed political opinion, such opinion being anti-government and pro-LTTE, arising as a result of having a family member who was a member of the LTTE, his Tamil ethnicity, his youth, his former residence in the east of Sri Lanka, as well as his membership of a particular social group including relatives of former LTTE members, Sri Lankan refugees returning from India to Sri Lanka, and returned, failed asylum seekers of Tamil ethnicity from Australia.  109. The Tribunal has not accepted any of the applicant’s claims in relation to past harm (other than before the conflict ended, which the Tribunal does not consider relevant to the issue of future harm). The Tribunal does not accept that the applicant has otherwise ever previously come to the adverse attention of the Sri Lankan authorities or any groups or organisations nor that he has ever had any previous past political involvement. It does not accept there is any reason, at the time he left Sri Lanka in June 2012, for him to be imputed with an anti-government opinion, nor to have been suspected of any involvement with the LTTE. It does not accept, on the basis of the adverse credibility finding, that there was a clash and that the authorities only arrested the Tamils (including the applicant's brother) and not the Sinhalese, or that the applicant’s brother was arrested because he looks like the applicant, or that his brother was detained or questioned about him, nor that anyone else has shown any adverse interest in the applicant. It will now consider the fears and claims, and the country information, in relation to future harm.  110. The Tribunal put to the applicant that it had considered the relevant country information and that it did not appear that he faced a real chance of serious harm or a real risk of significant harm, for the many reasons raised by him. He disagreed, and said that there are lots of problems, a lot of people suffer in Sri Lanka, Tamils are not respected and he wants to live in peace and he is being a good citizen in Australia. The Tribunal has considered all of the claim, evidence and submissions, and relevant country evidence, in making its findings concerning future harm. The Tribunal turned to the issue of the applicant’s claim concerning the Karuna Group and relevantly held:   112. There is no credible evidence before the Tribunal that the Karuna group or any other state sponsored or affiliated group has targeted or held any adverse interest in the applicant because of his ethnicity or any other aspect of his profile such as being a returnee; nor does the Tribunal accept that there is any credible evidence before it to suggest that any such group will seek for any reason to cause the applicant harm. The Tribunal does not accept that there is a real chance of serious harm from the Karuna group or any other state-sponsored or affiliated group. In relation to the applicant’s ethnicity, place of origin, implication as LTTE anti-government because of this ethnicity, illegal departure from Sri Lanka and application for asylum in Australia, the Tribunal relevantly held:  113. The Tribunal has considered whether the applicant will face harm because of his Tamil ethnicity, and whether he will be imputed with a political opinion as anti-government/pro-LTTE, by virtue of his ethnicity, place of origin (in the east, [Y]), being a previous refugee returnee from India, illegal departure from Sri Lanka to Australia, failed application for asylum in Australia a western country, and return from Australia.  ...  116. The Tribunal has not accepted that the applicant has any LTTE connections, nor that he has ever been suspected of LTTE involvement in the past. The Tribunal finds that the applicant has never been involved with, accused or imputed of being involved with, the LTTE in the past, it also does not accept that he has any family members or friends (such as Karen, or his brother) who have been involved with, accused or imputed of being involved with, the LTTE in the past.  117. The Tribunal accepts that the applicant left Sri Lanka illegally. As noted in the DFAT Report and put to the applicant at hearing, there have been thousands of (failed) asylum seekers returned to Sri Lanka since 2009, including from Australia, the US, Canada, UK, and other European countries. The Tribunal thus accepts that there is a real chance (and risk) that the Sri Lankan authorities will assume that the applicant is returning involuntarily as a failed asylum seeker from Australia.  ...  122. ...The Tribunal has also considered the other more recent reports referred to; however, as explained below, the Tribunal is not satisfied that a person with a profile such as the applicant faces a real chance of serious harm or a real risk of significant harm.  ...  132. ... The Tribunal is not satisfied that there is any reason for the applicant to be on the stop list, nor does it accept there is reason for the authorities to suspect the applicant is involved in separatist or criminal activities, nor that he is on a watch list. The Tribunal has found that the applicant was not questioned or harassed or harmed during the time he spent in Sri Lanka when he returned from India; the Tribunal does not accept on the evidence before it that there is a real chance or a real risk that he has been, or is, suspected of any involvement in the resurgence of the LTTE, including for the reason that he had previously been in India and has subsequently been in Australia, a western country where there is a Tamil diaspora. The Tribunal is not satisfied on the evidence before it that the applicant faces a real chance or a real risk of being on a stop list or watchlist or suspected of being involved in anti-government activities.  133. ... However, the Tribunal is not satisfied on the evidence before it, and taking into account his profile, that the applicant faces a real chance or a real risk of being imputed with an anti-government political opinion, or being considered as someone who may be involved in reforming the LTTE or protest movements.  134. ...on the evidence before it, the Tribunal is not satisfied that the Sri Lankan authorities suspect failed asylum seekers of being persons of interest, or traitors, just because they travelled to a western country such as Australia to seek asylum. The Tribunal does not accept that anyone will consider that he has “run away” by coming to Australia by boat, and thus has something to hide.  ...  138. ...The Tribunal considers that having regard to the applicant’s profile, which is not within the parameters discussed, the credible available information indicates that the applicant does not face a real chance of serious harm, or a real risk of significant harm, having regard to changed country conditions since the end of the conflict. The Tribunal is not satisfied on the basis of available country evidence that being a young, male Tamil, from [Y] who has travelled to a western country (Australia), and claimed asylum, leads to an imputation that the person is anti-government or has links with LTTE or other separatist organisations or the active political diaspora. The Tribunal is not satisfied that there is credible country evidence before it to support the assertion that just because the applicant departed illegally and claimed asylum in Australia (and is a young, male, Tamil from [Y]), he will be imputed as having an anti-government opinion/LTTE opinion, or involvement in the reformation of LTTE or the politically active diaspora, or will be otherwise of adverse interest to the authorities.  139. The Tribunal is not satisfied that the applicant has suffered har111 since the end of the conflict as a result of his ethnicity, gender, age, place of origin or as a returnee from India; nor does it accept that he has suffered harm because he has been imputed with any pro-LTTE or· anti-government political opinion; the Tribunal has not accepted that he has previously come to the adverse attention of the Sri Lankan authorities (or other organisations).  140. The Tribunal does not accept that now, the Sri Lankan authorities treat every Tamil as a suspected LTTE member. While the Tribunal accepts that the authorities fear the regrouping or reformation of an entity similar to the LTTE, the Tribunal does not accept the claim that it is for this reason that any Tamil male is a suspect. Further, the Tribunal does not accept that he faces being suspected of involvement in the politically active Tamil diaspora. The Tribunal does not accept that the applicant will have an increased or “bigger” profile due to being a failed asylum seeker, who had already returned from India, given the significant numbers of failed asylum-seekers returned to Sri Lanka.  141. Having regard to the country information, and the individual circumstances of this applicant, the Tribunal is not satisfied that he faces a real chance of persecution now or in the reasonably foreseeable future, or a real risk of significant harm, because of his Tamil ethnicity, his place of origin and return), that he will be suspected of links to the LTTE or other Tamil or anti-government organisations, or because he travelled to India then returned, then to Australia illegally by boat and is presumed to have claimed asylum. The Tribunal is not satisfied that these factors (as well as his youth and gender) whether individually or cumulatively, support a finding that there is a well-founded fear of persecution for the applicant. The Tribunal then considered the processes the applicant would face upon return to Sri Lanka and held that the Immigrants and Emigrants Act (Sri Lanka) was not a law that was discriminatory or indicated a discriminatory intention and was not applied in a discriminatory manner. The Tribunal took into account the conditions to which the applicant would be exposed in the enforcement of that law and relevantly concluded:  164. The Tribunal has considered the applicant’s claims individually, and on a cumulative basis, having regard to the findings that the applicant is not a credible witness concerning past or future harm feared, as well as the relevant country information, other than those claims accepted above, the Tribunal rejects all the various claims made and finds that he does not have a well-founded fear of Convention-related persecution for any of the reasons put forward by him, or on his behalf. The Tribunal then turned to the issue of complementary protection and relevantly concluded:   173. ... The Tribunal is satisfied that he will return and live with his family, and that he will be able to obtain work, noting he has previous work experience, as well as work experience from Australia. The Tribunal has not accepted that he has been previously discriminated against, harassed or harmed since the end of the conflict nor does it accept that he faces a real risk of being discriminated against, harassed or harmed, either at the hands of the authorities or any organisations or groups who work with them.  174. For the reasons provided above. the Tribunal is not satisfied on the evidence before it, including the changed country conditions since the end of the conflict and the applicant's individual circumstances, that the applicant faces a real risk of significant harm from the Sri Lankan authorities, the Karuna group or any other state-sponsored or affiliated group or paramilitaries, or because he had previously returned from India, or because he is from [Y], or because he is a young male Tamil, or because he left Sri Lanka by boat and travelled to Australia where there is a Tamil Diaspora, and claimed asylum and will be returned as a failed asylum seeker. The Tribunal is not satisfied that the applicant faces a real risk of being imputed with a profile which would draw the adverse attention of any of the authorities, persons or organisations or communities claimed, nor that he faces a real risk of being rounded up as a suspect, or harassed or detained by the authorities in his home area.  175. The Tribunal is not satisfied that any of the factors contributing to the applicant's profile, whether individually or cumulatively, support a finding that there is a real risk of significant harm for the applicant.  176. On the evidence before it, and for the reasons discussed above, and having considered the claims singularly and cumulatively, the Tribunal is not satisfied that there are substantial grounds for believing that, as a necessary and foreseeable consequence of the applicant being removed from Australia to a receiving country, namely Sri Lanka, that there is a real risk he will suffer significant harm. Accordingly, the Tribunal finds that the applicant does not satisfy the requirements of s.36(2)(aa) of the Act. It was in those circumstances the Tribunal concluded that the applicant was not a person in respect of whom Australia has a protection obligation and that the applicant did not meet the criteria under ss.36(2)(a) or 36(2)(aa).  In relation to the ground raised by the application, I accept the first respondent’s submission that the Tribunal plainly understood the correct test to be applied and did apply the correct test. The Tribunal correctly identified the relevant law in relation to a well-founded fear. The particulars that the applicant provided in respect of the assertion of a jurisdictional error are, in substance, an impermissible challenge to the adverse findings made by the Tribunal and those adverse findings by the Tribunal were clearly open. It is clear that the Tribunal took into account the applicant’s ethnicity, age and area from which he came.  The adverse findings made at paras.118 to 140 and 141 and 164 and the adverse findings in relation to the applicant’s claim of being a young Tamil from a particular area were open on the material before the Tribunal. It is clear the Tribunal also took into account the applicant’s fear of being imputed with an LTTE political opinion, relevantly, in paras.89 to 90, 116 to 117 and 138 and 164.  The adverse finding by the Tribunal in relation to the applicant’s fear in respect of being imputed with the LTTE political opinion was clearly open on the material before the Tribunal.  Nothing was said by the applicant to identify any jurisdictional error. The grounds in the application failed to identify any jurisdictional error.  The application is dismissed.I certify that the preceding twenty (20) paragraphs are a true copy of the reasons for judgment of Judge StreetAssociate:  Date:  19 October 2015       \",\n",
       " 'BGR15 v Minister for Immigration & Anor [2015] FCCA 2849 (30 October 2015)': \" (As Corrected)  This is an application for a Constitutional writ within the Court’s jurisdiction under s.476 of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) in respect of the decision of the Tribunal dated 30 May 2015, affirming that a decision of the delegate not to grant the applicant a Protection (Class XA) visa.  The applicant was found to be a citizen of Iran and his claims were assessed against that country.  The applicant claimed to fear persecution in Iran for the reason of his Khawari (Hazara) ethnicity, imputed political opinion and membership of an alleged social group of returnees from a western country. The applicant claimed the Khawaris were discriminated against in Iran.  The applicant claimed that he had consistently been asked to confirm his nationality by Iranian authorities despite being born in Iran, and had a number of meetings with Iranian officials.  The applicant claimed that after he threatened to take the matter to international organisations about six months before his departure from Iran for Australia, he was taken from his home by officers of the Ministry of Intelligence and National Security, held overnight and handcuffed, punched and threatened, that if he complained about Iran he would be harmed. The applicant claimed he would be killed if he returned to Iran because they would know he had complained about Iran.  The applicant also claimed that he had been accused of fraudulently obtaining Iranian citizenship.  The Tribunal found that the applicant was generally credible but had exaggerated some aspects of his claim, particularly in relation to his detention by the Ministry of Intelligence and National Security (MISIRI).  Relevantly, the Tribunal said:  30. ... While the Tribunal had concerns about the applicant’s evidence at the beginning of the hearing after listening to the recording of the hearing, the Tribunal considers that the applicant’s claims and evidence have been generally consistent from his entry interview dated 27 May 2012 to hearing. From time to time the Tribunal considers the applicant exaggerated his evidence, particularly in relation to the incident where he claims to have been detained by MISIRI but that did not detract from his overall credibility. In relation to the incident involving the MISIRI, relevantly the Tribunal said:  23. The applicant claimed that he has consistently been asked to attend official meetings to confirm his nationality. Present at the meetings were several people including intelligence people and he indicated he was provided with an official advocate who was an Iranian citizen and a delegate of the prosecutor. He asserted that 5 years ago he was taken by intelligence officers, asked about his family origins then released and had no further issues until about 6 months prior to his departure from Iran. At the last meeting he threatened to seek assistance from international organisations and 3 days later was taken from his home, held overnight and questioned and threatened that if he sought assistance from the international community, the Iranian authorities would deal with him harshly and he would be taken to the Revolutionary Court. The delegate had concerns about the veracity of the applicant’s claim in that he claims to have struggled with this problem for 20 years and it seems that the only time he was personally questioned and detained was when he threatened to go to the international community to complain about his treatment. The delegate gave the applicant the benefit of the doubt on the basis that he had been credible in his overall testimony and that the country information indicates that these kind of detainments are common in Iran and accepted that his detention and questioning may have been true. There is a reference to the following heading and passage as follows (CB169):  Claims have been threatened by intelligence officers after the applicant threatened he would seek help from the international community  ...  I have some doubt about the veracity of the applicant’s claim to have been detained as described above. By the applicant’s own assertion he has been struggling with this problem for twenty years and it seems the only time he has been personally questioned and detained is after he ‘spoke out’ and threatened to go to an international organisation to complain about his treatment.  Even though this claim may have been embellished to strengthen his claims, on the basis that the applicant has been overall credible in his testimony and that country information supports that these kind of detainments by intelligence officers are common in Iran, I will afford the applicant the benefit of the doubt and accept it as true.   Continuing the delegate summarised the claims of the applicant and, relevantly, in this regard at CB164-165 said:  The applicant claimed that six months before he fled Iran, two men from the MISIRI came to his home; he was blindfolded and taken to what he believed was the MISIRI office in Marshhad.  He claimed he was held overnight and questioned and threatened that if he sought assistance from the international community, the Iranian authorities would deal with him harshly and he would be taken to the Revolutionary Court. At the time of making the application for a protection visa in Part C the applicant had said, relevantly (CB15):  1. Why did you leave your country of nationality (country of residence)?  I left Iran because about 20 years there is huge discrimination against people like us. There is not enough democracy in Iran.  The Iranian authorities took all documents from us.  My daughter who is 11 years has no document.  We went on holidays and we could not take her along.  Everyday they throw my younger daughter from school and she was humiliated among other students.  She asked me where are we from?  I have my father’s documents which show he was Iranian and my documents but there is a Council in Marshhad of 7 members.  They asked my questions.  I told them I was born in Iran and done a lot for the country and they said these are not important for us.  The 7 members come from different government organizations.  I told them these documents if you don’t believe me I will go to international humanitarian organizations and tell them the situation in Iran.  They kept me for one night.  They said if you proceed, we will introduce you to the revolutionary court.  Now they don’t know I have passport. If they know I have passport, they will question me how I got one. We have not still confirmed your citizenship.  They will recognise it as a crime.  This issue made me crazy.  My father passed away because of this issue all his issue all his life.  I have struggling with this issue for 20 years.  I have a lot for Iran and after working for 40 years, still I’m not sure where I am from.  That was the reason why I let for Australia.  Australia being a country which respect human beings.    (Emphasis added) The applicant also provided a statutory declaration which relevantly said (CB85-86):  14.  My daughter has no identification documents.  We were unable to take her with us whenever we travelled to another country.  My daughter’s school sent her back home every day.  She was humiliated among other students.   15. I told them that if they could not resolve the matter I would go to international organisations to seek assistance.    16. After two nights, two men from MISIRI came to my home at night.   17. I was blindfolded and was taken to a place I believe is the MISIRI Office in Marshhad. I was detained overnight where I was questioned.  They threatened me and said that if I were to say that I would seek assistance from international organisations again, they would deal with me harshly and take me to the Revolutionary Court.   18. They do not know that I had a passport.  If they knew I would be seriously punished.    19.  I have struggling with this problem for around 20 years and feel as if I have no identity.  I still do not know where I am from.    20.  I decided to flee Iran.  I travelled using my genuine passport to Qatar and Malaysia.  I then found a smuggler to assist with my travels to Australia.   Relevantly, in that statutory declaration underneath the heading “What I fear may happen if I return to that country”, the applicant said:  22. I fear I will be arrested and imprisoned if I return to Iran. Under the heading “Why I think I will be harmed / mistreated if I return to that country”, the applicant said relevantly:  25. I will be harmed and persecuted because I am Hazara. I will be investigated and authorities will insist that I am not a citizen of Iran.  I will be accused of having obtained fraudulent documents in Iran. The Tribunal found that the applicant left Iran legally and was in possession of a valid Iranian passport issued in his name.  The Tribunal in its reasons under a bold heading “Assessment of claims”, and a subheading “Summary application and delegate’s decision”, relevantly said:  23. The applicant claimed that he has consistently been asked to attend official meetings to confirm his nationality. Present at the meetings were several people including intelligence people and he indicated he was provided with an official advocate who was an Iranian citizen and a delegate of the prosecutor. He asserted that 5 years ago he was taken by intelligence officers, asked about his family origins then released and had no further issues until about 6 months prior to his departure from Iran. At the last meeting he threatened to seek assistance from international organisations and 3 days later was taken from his home, held overnight and questioned and threatened that if he sought assistance from the international community, the Iranian authorities would deal with him harshly and he would be taken to the Revolutionary Court. The delegate had concerns about the veracity of the applicant’s claim in that he claims to have struggled with this problem for 20 years and it seems that the only time he was personally questioned and detained was when he threatened to go to the international community to complain about his treatment. The delegate gave the applicant the benefit of the doubt on the basis that he had been credible in his overall testimony and that the country information indicates that these kind of detainments are common in Iran and accepted that his detention and questioning may have been true. The delegate also referred to whether there was a well-founded fear of persecution and relevantly said (CB172):  Finding on well-foundedness  I am not satisfied the applicant has a real chance of being persecuted for a Refugees Convention reason.  I therefore find the applicant’s fear of persecution, as defined under the Refugee Convention, is not well-founded.  In relation to whether the claim of harm amounted to significant harm, the delegate said (CB171-172):  During his oral testimony the applicant described what occurred when he was detained by intelligence officers.  When the applicant was asked whether he was harmed during his overnight detainment by intelligence officers, he responded that; they opened a case against him and while ‘they were not polite, they did not hurt him.’ In addition, his description of what was said to him was rather informal and there was no evidence that it was anything more than a discussion of what they ‘had heard that he said during a meeting’.  He was released the next morning without being charged, nor was there any official arrest of summons.  In addition, the applicant was able to leave Iran after this incident on his genuine Iranian passport without incident.    Therefore I am not satisfied that the applicant is currently of any interest to the Iranian authorities.  However, the applicant stated at interview that should he be returned to Iran, he will continue to fight for his and his daughter’s rights.  Notwithstanding this, it has been demonstrated by the applicant that his actions in seeking his daughter’s identity documents have occurred in an official capacity in his local province.  He has been invited to attend formal meetings by official correspondence, the meetings were held in the presence of officials including members of the MISIRI and importantly he has been represented by an official advocate supplied by the government.    I acknowledge that these meetings have occurred over a long period of time, particularly since his daughter’s birth in 2000 and without results in favour of the applicant.  However, apart from one occasion of detainment that cannot be described as anything other than questioning and threats to stop, there is no evidence to suggest the applicant would suffer severe harm for these reasons if he was to return to Iran and continue to attend these meetings.  The applicant appeared before the Tribunal on 2 December 2014 to give evidence and present arguments, and was assisted by an interpreter and was also represented by his registered migration agent.  Prior to the hearing, detailed submissions were provided by the applicant’s representative to the Tribunal dated 28 February 2014, which referred to in para.25 of the Tribunal’s reasons.  I these submissions under the heading “Does the applicant have a well-founded fear of persecution on the basis of his race/nationality?”, para.60 provided:  60. An October 2005 report from the Afghanistan Research and Evaluation Unit (AREU)12 also provides background information on Khawari, particularly those residing in Marshhad, where the applicant and his family live, stating that the citizenship of Khawari had been disputed and referred to ‘many’ Khawari having been issued with amayesh or refugee registration cards. The report indicated that many had migrated to Iran from Afghanistan in the previous century, integrated and became naturalised Iranians and were now having their citizenship disputed. Under the heading “Does the applicant have a well-founded fear of persecution on the basis of his imputed political opinion?”, the submissions provided relevantly (CB207):  70. In her decision, the Delegate was not satisfied that the Applicant is currently of any interest to the Iranian authorities and he would not suffer severe harm if he continued to try to obtain his and his daughter’s birth certificates through meetings with the local council.    71. Notwithstanding this finding, the Delegate also noted that ‘apart from one occasion of detainment that cannot be described as anything other than questioning and threats to stop, there is no evidence to suggest the applicant would suffer sever harm for these reasons’. This statement is internally contradictory.    72. The Applicant was threatened that if he were to continue trying to obtain his and his daughter’s birth certificates, he would suffer harsh consequences which would amount to a threat to the Applicant’s life or liberty and thus persecution.  After this threat, the Applicant departed Iran to ensure that he did not suffer the harm that was threatened by the MISIRI officers. This therefore is evidence that there is a real risk that the Applicant would suffer serious harm were he to return to Iran.   73. Furthermore, as the Applicant sought asylum in Australia, we will be considered to have acted on his threats to seek international help.   Relevantly, the Tribunal found  69. The applicant’s evidence to the Tribunal was not consistent in relation to his daughter’s access to education. The initial evidence was that it was only his younger daughter who had difficulty enrolling in school because he was unable to provide his original birth certificate [AA] but his wife obtained a letter of support from the committee and she was able to be enrolled. He told the Tribunal that his daughters were not attending school and when asked when his older daughter stopped attending school, he responded about 5 years ago. When the applicant was questioned further by the Tribunal, he stated that they attend school but do not get any of their records because they do not have any identity documents. The delegate found based on the applicant’s evidence that his daughter was able to attend school after his wife provided a letter of support from the education department and that it was that she had difficulties enrolling like other children. Based on the inconsistent evidence provided because they are Khawari or considered to be Afghanis.  70. The Tribunal has considered the applicant’s claims that without identification documents he will be given limited access to welfare and medical services. The tribunal finds that the applicant has copies of his documents which he has used in the past to access these services and does not accept that he does not have identification documents sufficient to continue to access these services.  71. The Tribunal has considered the applicant’s claims in relation to his employment in that he claims to have worked illegally and that it was only when he held identity documents that he was able to work for the Iran Bank. The Tribunal notes from his work history provided in his Form 866 application for protection that the applicant has been employed in a number of jobs including a taxi driver, working in the family shop and that he has also been self-employed working as an exporter and as a retailer and wholesaler. The Tribunal does not accept that he has suffered such harm in relation to his income and finances as to constitute serious harm. The applicant has been able to earn an income and provide for his family and indicates that he owns his home and other property which he rents. The Tribunal does not accept that he has been denied the ability to earn an income or that he has to work illegally to earn that income because of his ethnicity Khawari or because he was considered to be Afghani . In making its findings, the Tribunal has had regard to the instances of serious harm that are set out in s.91R(2), although it is conscious that these are not exhaustive. It finds to be remote them chance that the applicant would suffer serious harm in the form, for instance, of significant economic hardship that threatens his capacity to subsist or denial of capacity to earn a livelihood of any kind where the denial threatens his capacity to subsist. The Tribunal is not satisfied, looking to the reasonably foreseeable future, that there is a real chance that he will be persecuted in this regard for reason of his ethnicity or any other Convention reason. It is not satisfied that there is a real risk that he will suffer significant harm in this regard.  72. The applicant has claimed that he is called names, such as “Afghani” and that his daughters have been accused of being Afghans. The Tribunal accepts based on the country information that there is some hostility towards people perceived to be Afghans. However, it does not accept that this amounts to serious harm or significant harm. Looking to the reasonably foreseeable future, the Tribunal is not satisfied that there is any real chance that the applicant will suffer serious harm at the hands of other Iranians for reason of his Khavari/Hazara ethnicity, imputed Afghan nationality, being a person who is perceived to be of Afghan origin or for any Convention reason. Nor is it satisfied that there are substantial grounds for believing that there is a real risk that he will suffer significant harm at the hands of other Iranians for these reasons.  ...  76. Having regard to the independent information, the Tribunal accepts that the applicant may attract some attention as a person of Khavari ethnicity and Afghan/ Hazara. It accepts that the applicant may face being stopped on a regular basis and asked for documentation. However, as noted above, the Tribunal finds that the applicant is in a position to demonstrate that he is in fact an Iranian citizen. It may be that he regularly comes to the attention of the authorities and that he suffers some harassment in the form of regular checking because of his Afghan/ Hazara appearance, which is consistent with the country information. It accepts that, in the course of checking, he has suffered some harassment. However, the Tribunal does not accept that such instances of checking, even considered cumulatively and even accepting that they involved some harassment, constitute serious harm or significant harm.  77. The Tribunal accepts that the applicant may continue to face a degree of discrimination and harassment from the Iranian authorities in the form of regular checking. Nevertheless, looking to the reasonably foreseeable future, it finds to be remote the chance that the applicant would suffer persecution at the hands of the Iranian authorities for reason of his Khawari ethnicity or imputed Afghan nationality or for reason of being a person perceived to be of Afghan origin. The Tribunal is not satisfied that the applicant’s Khawari ethnicity and Afghan/ Hazara appearance give rise to substantial grounds for believing that the applicant will suffer significant harm at the hands of the Iranian authorities, including the Basij. In making these findings, the Tribunal has taken account of DFAT’s statement that it is “possible that individual members of the Basij discriminate against ethnic and religious minorities” and that there is an element of unpredictability in their behaviour.  78. The applicant is fearful that if returned to Iran he will face harm because they will accuse him of following up on his threat to report the Iranian Government to the international community because of their discrimination against him. It was submitted that the fact that the applicant had sought asylum in the West would imply that they had made comments against the regime, that he had complained to the international organisations about his treatment as a Hazara in Iran and they would harm him on his return as he was told that if they ever hear that he has complained they will kill him and he signed an undertaking not to complain. The applicant claims that despite leaving Iran on his valid Iranian passport, he made his exit illegal as they would put him in the system and they will know he left and how he obtained his passport.  ...  81. The applicant claimed at hearing that he was tortured when he was taken by the MISIRI from his house after stating at the last meeting that he would complain to the international community. The delegate when considering his evidence on this point had doubt about the veracity of his claim and stated that it may have been embellished to strengthen his claims. However, the delegate gave the applicant the benefit of the doubt on the basis that he had been credible in his overall testimony and that the country information indicates that these kinds of detainments are common in Iran and accepted that his detention and questioning may have been true. The Tribunal finds that the applicant’s evidence as to his detention was not consistent with his evidence to the delegate, in that to the delegate he indicates that while they were not polite, they did not hurt him, yet to the Tribunal he indicates they punched him and there was pain. His evidence was consistent in that he was asked about his life. While the Tribunal accepts that the applicant made a comment about taking the matter to the international community, he was detained a few days later and questioned further, the Tribunal does not accept that this has given him a profile as a person in opposition to the Iranian Government. The Tribunal finds that the applicant has exaggerated his claims to have been told that if he complains it would be like digging his grave with his hands and they would take him to the Revolutionary Court for the purposes of enhancing his application. The Tribunal does not accept after a number of years of following up on his documents, he would suddenly be of interest to the Iranian authorities that they would suddenly place his house under observation and continually ask where he was or tell the shop keeper to inform them if they see him. The applicant departed Iran on his valid passport and there would be records of his departure. The Tribunal does not accept that the applicant has a profile or is of any interest to the Iranian authorities because he has continually followed up on his family’s identity documents or because on one occasion he threatened to complain to the international community.  ...  83. The Tribunal discussed the gist of such information with the applicant at the hearing. The Tribunal has found that the applicant has never been of adverse interest to the Iranian authorities in the past and is not of any current adverse interest. It is not satisfied that the fact that the applicant has been in a Western country and applied for asylum here gives rise to a real chance that he will be persecuted for reason of an imputed political opinion, for reason of being returnees who have unsuccessfully sought asylum in the west or for any Convention reason. Nor is it satisfied that these factors give rise to substantial grounds for believing that the applicants will suffer significant harm. In making these findings, the Tribunal has taken account of the applicants’ Khavari/ Hazara ethnicity.  84. The Tribunal has carefully considered all of the applicant’s claims and circumstances, both individually and cumulatively. However, looking to the reasonably foreseeable future, it is not satisfied that there is a real chance that the applicant will suffer persecution in Iran for reason of Khawari ethnicity, imputed Afghan nationality, an imputed political opinion or any other Convention reason. Nor is it satisfied that there are substantial grounds for believing that he will suffer significant harm. Having carefully considered all of the evidence, the Tribunal is not satisfied that it has substantial grounds for believing that, as a necessary and foreseeable consequence of the applicant being removed to Iran, there is a real risk that he will suffer significant harm in the form of being arbitrarily deprived of his life, having the death penalty carried out, or being subjected to torture, cruel or inhuman treatment or punishment, or degrading treatment or punishment. The grounds of the amended application are as follows:  1. The Tribunal failed to comply with s 414 of the Act because it failed to consider a component integer of the applicant’s claims for protection on the basis of his race, imputed political opinion or under s 36(2)(aa) of the Act.  Particulars  a. The applicant claimed to have a well-founded fear of persecution on the basis of his race (Khawari): submission to Tribunal dated 28 February 2014 (Submission) at [58]; Tribunal’s Decision at [7].  b. The applicant claimed that, following his father’s death in 1995, his family began having difficulties with their citizenship, and that the applicant’s original birth certificate was confiscated in 2000 when his youngest daughter, whom he was unable to register, was born: Tribunal’s Decision at [63]-[64]; Submission at [24]-[25]. The applicant claimed that the investigation of the applicant’s family was carried out by the Ministry of Intelligence and National Security of the Islamic Republic of Iran (MISIRI): Tribunal’s Decision at [26].  c. The applicant claimed to have attended the offices of the MISIRI about 8 times from 2000 onwards: Tribunal’s Decision at [12].  d. The applicant claimed that the problems he and his family faced in relation to identification documents were on account of being (Khawari): statutory declaration dated 31 July 2012 at [5], [13].  e. The Tribunal accepted that the applicant was “generally credible in his evidence”: Tribunal’s Decision at [30].  f. The Tribunal accepted that the “evidence before the Tribunal indicates that the applicant’s birth certificate and other identity documents along with the identity documents of other family members were confiscated and he consistently sought to have the documents returned and the questions over his citizenship resolved, attending and giving evidence to the committee on a regular basis”: Tribunal’s Decision at [68].  g. The applicant claimed that, despite the meetings he had attended since 2000, he was “still unable to register his daughter” and that he was “threatened that if he were to continue trying to obtain his and his daughter’s birth certificates, he would suffer harsh consequences which would amount to a threat to the Applicant’s life or liberty”: Submission at [60], [72].  h. The Tribunal rejected claims made by the applicant regarding his daughters being denied education (at [69]), but failed to consider:  i. whether the applicant would continue to try and obtain a birth certificate for his youngest daughter if returned to Iran; and  ii. whether, on that basis, he satisfied ss 36(2)(a) or (aa) of the Act.  i. As a result of the failures outlined in the preceding particular, the Tribunal committed a jurisdictional error: see HTUN v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (2001) 194 ALR 244 (Htun).  2. The Tribunal failed in a second way to comply with s 414 of the Act because it failed to consider a component integer of the applicant’s claims for protection on the basis of his race, imputed political opinion or under s 36(2)(aa) of the Act.  Particulars  a. The applicant repeats particular 1(a) to (e).  b. The applicant claimed to be at risk of harm on the basis of his imputed political opinion: Tribunal’s Decision at [26].  c. The Tribunal accepted that “that the Iranian authorities have investigated the applicant’s Iranian citizenship and that they investigated his father before him, and that he has become frustrated such that he threatened to complain to international bodies”: at [80].  d. The Tribunal accepted that, after making the threat referred to in the preceding particular, the applicant “was detained a few days later and questioned further”: at [81]. The applicant claimed that he was threatened that “if he continued to pursue seeking help from international organisations, he would face harsh consequences”: Submission at [41].  e. The Tribunal accepted that it may be that the applicant “regularly comes to the attention of the authorities and that he suffers some harassment in the form of regular checking because of his Afghan/ Hazara appearance, which is consistent with the country information” and that “in the course of checking, he has suffered some harassment” (at [76]). The Tribunal also accepted that “the applicant may continue to face a degree of discrimination and harassment from the Iranian authorities in the form of regular checking”: at [77].  f. Although the Tribunal found that applicant’s threat to complain to international bodies was not, of itself, such as to give him a profile of a person in opposition to the Iranian Government (at [81]), especially in light of the Tribunal’s findings in the preceding particular and the applicant’s claim in particular 2(d), the Tribunal needed to consider whether, if the applicant was returned to Iran, he:  i. might carry out his threat to complain to international bodies and whether on that basis, he satisfied ss 36(2)(a) or (aa) of the Act; and  ii. might refrain from carrying out his threat to complain to international bodies because of the harm he might fear if he carried out that threat, and whether, on that basis, he satisfied ss 36(2)(a) or (aa) of the Act.  g. As a result failing to consider the matters outlined in the preceding particular, the Tribunal committed a jurisdictional error: see Htun.  3. The Tribunal failed to comply with s 425(1) of the Act in assessing the applicant’s claim for protection on the basis of his race, imputed political opinion and complementary protection.  Particulars  a. The applicant claimed that, following his father’s death in 1995, his family began having difficulties with their citizenship, and that the applicant’s original birth certificate was confiscated in 2000 when his youngest daughter, whom he was unable to register, was born: Tribunal’s Decision at [63]-[64]; Submission at [24]-[25]. The applicant claimed that the investigation of the applicant’s family was carried out by MISIRI: Tribunal’s Decision at [26].  b. The applicant claimed to have attended the offices of the MISIRI about 8 times from 2000 onwards: Tribunal’s Decision at [12].  c. The Tribunal accepted that “that the Iranian authorities have investigated the applicant’s Iranian citizenship and that they investigated his father before him, and that he has become frustrated such that he threatened to complain to international bodies”: at [80].  d. The Tribunal accepted that, after making the threat referred to in the preceding particular, the applicant “was detained a few days later and questioned further”: at [81].  e. The applicant claimed that he was threatened that “if he threatened to take the matter to the international organisations again they would deal with him harshly and take him to the Revolutionary Court”: at [13].  f. The Delegate accepted that the applicant was threatened as set out in the preceding particular: CB 169.  g. The Tribunal did not accept that the applicant had received the threat to take him to the Revolutionary Court: at [81].  h. The Tribunal failed to give the applicant any notice that the question of whether the applicant had been threatened in this manner was an issue arising in relation to the decision under review, and thereby failed to comply with s 425(1) of the Act: SZBEL v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2006] HCA 63;  (2006) 228 CLR 152 at  [32]. In relation to ground 1, I accept the first respondent’s submission that there was no clearly articulated claim that the applicant would try and obtain a birth certificate for his youngest daughter if he returned to Iran.  Whilst I accept that there is a reference in the delegate’s decision at CB172 and repeated in CB174 to the applicant continuing to fight for his and his daughter’s rights, that does not mean that there was a claim that the Tribunal was required to address, as alleged in ground 1, in respect of the obtaining of a birth certificate for the applicant’s youngest daughter. I accept the first respondent’s submission that it cannot be said that there is a substantial, clearly articulated argument relying upon established facts to the effect that the applicant claimed he feared harm if he returned to Iran “because he would continue to try to obtain a birth certificate for his youngest daughter”.  Further, I do not accept that this was a claim that can be said to have clearly arisen or to have been sufficiently identified, that it should have been addressed by the Tribunal.  Accordingly, ground 1 fails to make out any jurisdictional error. In relation to ground 2, I accept the first respondent’s submission that this again was not a claim, that was clearly articulated, that the applicant might carry out his threat to complain to international bodies if the applicant returned to Iran or that he might refrain to carry out his threat to complain to international bodies because of harm he might fear if he carried out that threat.  In my opinion, no such claim clearly arises or was sufficiently raised on material before the Tribunal and the Tribunal was not required to address the matter raised in ground 2.  Accordingly, ground 2 failed to make out any jurisdictional error. In relation to ground 3, the transcript reveals that the delegate said at 3:  MEMBER: We're here today because you have applied for an application for protection which was refused by the delegate.   You are not happy with that decision so you have sort to have it reviewed under refugee review tribunal.  INTERPRETER: Yes exactly  MEMBER: It's my task today to conduct an independent review on that decision.  I'm having a fresh look at it which means I am taking a new look at your application. The Tribunal also said at pp.4-5:  MEMBER: ...  So as I said to you earlier my job is to try and take an independent review of the decision the decision by the delegate.  The purpose of this hearing is for you to give evidence and present arguments in support of your application.  And for me to ask you questions ah about matters in relation to your situation  ...  MEMBER: ...  Now it's very important that you tell me the truth.  This means if you do not know the answer to a question it is better to simple say so rather than guess.  The reason you should not guess is because it becomes apparent that you have not told the truth it may affect my assessment of your credibility on important aspects of your case. At p.11 the applicant told the Tribunal:  INTERPRETER: ...  Um so they told me that um you're Hazara you came from Afghanistan I said yes that's right all of the Hazara people they came from Afghanistan and I said that my grandfather was Hazara and he came from Afghanistan but they said no your father was Hazara and I didn't accept it   So with all of the service that I did in that country like I went to um army after Iran for two years like the service that people do it's the rule that people who turn 18 ah and ah with all of the service that I did so I just ignored that and they told they told me that I am Hazara and I said that if you don't answer or_ this matter so I will ah complain ah to the  Ah to all of the services which are about the human rights and different from human rights so I will complain then. And then-then after that was the two people from the ah information_ around they came and now I go to explain the paragraph 40.  And two days after those people who came to my home So after two days when those two people came behind my house and I opened the door maybe at that time so they didn't ask me this question or I didn't explain it.  So at that time those people who ah knock on my home and-and I opened the door and I said who are you so they just entered the house and one of those people ah did two punch on my face and my wife and ah so this So it was very obvious ah because of their_ or there gun or things that they had with them _so it was obvious that they were from the information people or the Iran so it's called_ and ah but they were ah out of there uniform.  And then they handcuff my hands and they took me in the car and they closed my eyes as well.  I guess about one and a half hours we just_ I don't know where it was   And at that time we arrived there so we got off and it was an obvious from his voice   So  Then that person had a punch in my head that I see that I feel the pain   And just member told me this exactly that just with a swearing the Afghan just got off.  Which means that you been_ Afghan guy just get off  So when we were up in that centre sorry I don't know how many states it had  So they opened my eyes  At that stage  But my  I was handcuffed and the questioning started  And then they started questioning from the first stage of my life my life time  From the beginning of my life  And it took several hours  So with ah_ so you want to complain against Iran?  And some of the papers that they didn't show me they just got signature and fingerprint off me on those papers they didn't show me what was on those documents.  And  And they told me if one more time you repeat this so it's like you are digging your grave with your hands.  I will never forget this_  So  So in answer anyone who wants to go against Government or Iran so they hand them to the court of Enqelab and um ah recognising that person who is a person who is against the Government of Islam and Iran  And  And they just hang that person easily and they have hanged many people like just as easy as that.  And I think that in a different paragraph so I just ah refer to this part um not as much as_  I just had to refer to that ah very short and briefly  So  They would  They would have you will be digging your grave with your hands so that means they 100% of getting killed  And another matter is that another few times that that I was in contact with my family  And my wife said ah several time that people come and they said that they are your friend and they ask where-where is the husband whereabouts they ask where is he and the wife is saying that I just __ _  So the wife was_ maybe they were somebody from the information of the Iran and they ah man who has got a sharp edges in front in beginning of our street enter in our street so he told my wife that some people they are asking questions about your husband so is there any problems happening?  And they told the shop owner um and said if any one ah sees this gentleman just contact a number_.  To inform them and ah this is what my wife told me and I think this um_ haven't been mentioned in my application.  So Ms Member I served this that in Iran this regime of_ so they if they want to hang anyone _so it is very easy for them to just to hang or kill someone.  So and I think this ah very-very important I didn't mean to_ so I just mentioned them so that you member I am under who would know about this.  May I explain more?  MEMBER: Yes you can  INTERPRETER: so it's very good that they a member here and the interpreter both are females', ladies  And when I got married from my marriage I've got two daughters and I can show you picture of my daughters  So here are my two daughters um with all of the service that I've done it Iran Government two years going to the army someone defends that country so they ignored all of those and they said that I am Afghan and because of that this my two daughters they can study other schools and ah my younger daughter that she can't go to school because we are Afghan so they don't enrol afghan people in these schools so day and night she is crying and you can see that emotionally how it affects a thirteen years old girl and ah many time ah other girls at this school has told my daughter because you are afghan you can't come to school and you can't study so I think that from human rights it is not right thing and emotionally it affects a thirteen years old girl very badly.  And ah my ah 13 years old d-ah girl tells me that my friends tell me that ah you_ like afghan people  So now you respected judge you can make the decision on all this.  MEMBER: you just said that both your daughters cant study is that true?  INTERPRETER: Yes  MEMBER: So both your daughters can't study in Iran  INTERPRETER: at the time they took off our ah ID Documents no they can't  MEMBER: they have taken your ID Documents?  INTERPRETER: What do you mean? So everything so maybe I have to make it clearer so or maybe I just didn't interpret well so like passport that we have in Australia that we have the ID's in Iranian they've got a passport so that's called_ so that's what he meant so he said that they took that one and all of their ID's  MEMBER: Did they take all the ID's for all of your family members  INTERPRETER: Yes all of them  So they've got so the Government got ...  MEMBER: So when did they take it?  INTERPRETER: so I can't remember the dates exactly but after_ years ...  After that my father died  Um so about twenty years ago when my father died so the Government of Iran they started investigating or questioning us and they took all of the families information_ so it's called_ so infor- that meaning information part_ took all of the families started questioning and interviewing us at that time my mother was alive as well so it's been two years here in Australia but I think about 11 years ago  Yeah that's all  So I am saying it was about 11 years ago that they took ah the documents from us the Iran Government  So all of my family like my brothers and their children my niece and nephew   Um daughters of my brothers ah anyone who they wanted to study so they couldn't continue studying  So I have to mention this the importance of the_ the Iranian um ID so its real important so my daughter ah daughter of my brother she couldn't get married because of she didn't have this ID so the marriage can't get registered.  And ah like boys ah when they don't have there_ like their Iranian ID like their passport so they can't ah_ ah t the service of_ which is_ two years' service for army and they can't get   aha there drivers licence or so they can't ah register marriage  Or they can't get any of the ID cards that they have to get them so they are just disconnected from all of this and they can't get those things_ affecting them.  MEMBER: So you're telling me your daughters don't have JD Cards?  INTERPRETER: So they've got a photo copy of their ID's but the original documentation has been taken by the government.  It's the_ saying like passports sorry  MEMBER: That's not consistent with what you've actually said earlier in relation to the ID documents you provided to the department.  INTERPRETER: Sorry can you please repeat it?  MEMBER: that's not consistent with the information the evidence he has previously given to the department.  INTERPRETER: he has given to which?  MEMBER: with the department.  INTERPRETER: The Department of Immigration?  MEMBER: MmmHmm  INTERPRETER: so you mean it's not connected with that?  MEMBER: well you've provided you have provided identity documents.   For your family members  Your previous evidence was that your eldest daughter had been attending school  And that your youngest daughter had been attending school but there were difficulties with her enrolment.  INTERPRETER: so it was that in that session of those 7 people so everywhere we just were getting a letter then we just can't enrol them to school and ah it was saying that the process 10 of investigating the passport ID's was just in process and you can temporarily enrol them in a school that at the end they came to the final decision that we are not Iranian.  MEMBER: that so when did they decide that you were not Iranian?  INTERPRETER: Last session  The date is given there I can't remember exactly that date  So now they g-the Government they've got all of my ah got all of our id's  MEMBER: I mentioned to you earlier about the importance of telling me the truth so that I do not draw adverse credibility concerns  About ...  INTERPRETER: sorry.  MEMBER: I am having some issues already with some inconsistencies in your statements in your file submissions made on your behalf by your representative and now as to what you were telling me right now is different I would like you to have a think about your evidence to me because right now I'm not feeling that you are telling you are being truthful to me about your circumstance ...  INTERPRETER: so just before you said please_ your statement now I'm just...  So you mean that this_ ah contradicting?  MEMBER: Yep The applicant also said:  INTERPRETER: as I said in the last session of the seven people it ah when they invalid all of my ID and I said that Iran there is no democracy and there is no human rights so I will complain against discrimination in Iran to other outside ah human rights ah nation or officers and ah because of this that I said so they threatened me and they took a signature off me and they told me if we hear that you have talked about this matter to anyone ah it's like just you have a dig your grave with your hands and your death will be for sure and they threatened me and ah tortured me and they told me if we hear something about this matter we just hand you to a court of Enqelab and ah you will be recognized as someone against the Iranian Government and the Iranian Islamic and they we will hang you and your death will be for sure and because all of this ah I'm afraid to go back to Iran um and I am one hundred percent sure if I would go back so my death would be for sure. Counsel for the applicant contended that the finding at para.81 was a rejection by the Tribunal that the applicant had received a threat to take him to the Revolutionary Court.  Counsel for the applicant read an affidavit that identified that the applicant had referred to the Revolutionary Court where, on p.13, there was a reference to the “Court of Enqelab” in the interpretation to the Tribunal and that there was a further reference to the Revolutionary Court in the reference to Court of Enqelab in the interpretation version before the Tribunal.  It is clear the Tribunal understood the references to Court as being the Revolutionary Court.   It is clear from the Tribunal’s identification of the claims, to which I have referred, that the Tribunal was well alive to the incident to which the applicant had referred and the threat that he would be taken to the Revolutionary Court as referred to in para.23 quoted above.  Materially, in the evidence before the Tribunal in describing that incident, the applicant included in the evidence before the Tribunal:  And they told me if one more time you repeat this so it's like you are digging your grave with your hands.  I will never forget this That assertion immediately proceeded the reference to being taken to the Revolutionary Court.  The applicant later in evidence to the Tribunal repeated that same assertion:  and they told me if we hear something about this matter we just hand you to a court of Enqelab and ah you will be recognized as someone against the Iranian Government and the Iranian Islamic and they we will hang you and your death will be for sure. Again, following that assertion by the applicant is a reference to the Revolutionary Court.  Nowhere had the applicant earlier suggested that he was told that it is like digging your grave with your own hands and the statement “I will never forget this” was linked to the threat that he would be handed to the Revolutionary Court.  It is clear in that regard that the applicant’s evidence in this respect was inconsistent with his earlier statement to which the Tribunal was referring when it raised the issue of concern about the inconsistencies in the applicant’s statement in evidence at p.16 quoted above. Contrary to the applicant’s submission, the Tribunal did not say that it did not accept that the applicant had received a threat to take him to the Revolutionary Court, rather the Tribunal identified in its assessment of credibility that the applicant had exaggerated his claims linking the assertion that he was told that it would be like digging his grave with his hands, to him being taken to the Revolutionary Court “for the purpose of enhancing his application”. It is clear from the Tribunal’s assessment of the applicant’s credit that the Tribunal recognised the applicant had been generally consistent, as referred to in para.30, but it was a matter for the Tribunal to make findings of credit and the observation of having exaggerated his claims by reference to being told it would be like digging his grave with his hands referable to being taken to the Revolutionary Court, was clearly an observation on credit that was open on the material before the Tribunal. I do not accept the applicant’s contention that the credibility finding by the Tribunal in that regard falls within the principle identified in SZBEL v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2006] HCA 63;  (2006) 228 CLR 152 at  [32].  Materially, the delegate had not accepted without equivocation the veracity of the applicant and expressed doubt relevant to the recounting by the applicant that he threatened to go to an international organisation to complain about his treatment and the delegate said:  Even though this claim may have been embellished to strengthen his claims, on the basis that the applicant has been overall credible in his testimony and that country information supports that these kind of detainments by intelligence officers are common in Iran, I will afford the applicant the benefit of the doubt and accept it as true. It is clear from the applicant’s reference to the delegate’s finding about being threatened that the issue of embellishment was raised by the delegate and, in my opinion, this is not a case where it can be said that the Tribunal did not give the applicant a sufficient opportunity to give evidence or make submissions about the incident.  I accept the force of the submission of the first respondent that the Tribunal in this case had raised the issue of whether the applicant was embellishing the account in relation to the incident involving the threat to take the applicant to the Revolutionary Court. Further, it cannot be said that the reference to having exaggerated the claim relating to digging his grave with his hands referable to being taken to the Revolutionary Court was a dispositive issue or should have been considered a dispositive issue of the kind identified in SZBEL at [35].  The Tribunal’s reasons are to be read as a whole and without a keen eye for error and, in that regard, the use of the conjunction in the reasons in para.81 to the incident involving being told it would be like digging his grave with his hands in reference to him being taken to the Revolutionary Court, was clearly the one incident.  This is not a case where there was a finding by the Tribunal that it did not accept that there had been no threat to take the applicant to the Revolutionary Court, and it is clear that the threat was part of the matters taken into account in the adverse findings in para.84 and also in para.72 on a fair reading of the Tribunal’s reasons as a whole.  Accordingly, ground 3 fails to make out any jurisdictional error.

       " 'BKG15 v Minister for Immigration & Anor [2015] FCCA 2890 (5 November 2015)': '  This is an application for a Constitutional writ within the Court’s jurisdiction under s.476 of Migration Act 1958 in respect of a decision of the Tribunal made on 25 June 2015 affirming the decision of the delegate not to grant the applicant a protection visa. The applicant was found to be a citizen of Iran and his claims were assessed as against that country. The applicant is a single man in his early thirties from Ahwaz who claims to fear harm because he has a profile as an activist and dissenter after he argued with a member of the Basij and allegedly, the applicant said he did not believe in Islam and criticised the Supreme Leader and Imam Khomeini.  The delegate accepted the applicant did argue with a Basij and that his house was searched and a laptop containing political material was seized as a result, but found these matters were not sufficient to attract attention of the authorities if he returned.  The delegate found there was neither a real chance that the applicant would be seriously harmed nor a real risk that he would be significantly harmed if he returned to Iran, and that the applicant did not have a well-founded fear of persecution. The grounds of the amended application are relevantly as follows:   Ground 2  The AAT committed a jurisdictional error because its credibility/factual findings generally in the decision depart from the Delegate\\'s reasons without warning for the purposes of Section 425 of the Migration Act and contrary to the requirements described by the High Court in SZBEL v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs & Anor [2006] HCA63.  PARTICULARS  (i) The delegate\\'s decision against which the applicant appealed accepted several of the facts alleged by the applicant that were rejected as illogical and implausible [see 3 of the AAT decision].  (ii) During the hearing the AAT did not inform the applicant that the particular findings of the delegate were suspect to challenge;  (iii) In part, the findings of the AA T were inconsistent with the findings of the Delegate, without the applicant and his representative being aware of the particular facts to be challenged.  (iv) The findings on point were fundamental to the decision of the AAT;  (v) The applicant did not have any or sufficient notice that the findings of the Delegate were to be departed from.  Ground 4  The decision of the AAT is affected by error because the AAT failed to give adequate reasons as required by section 430, Migration Act 1958 which provides as follows:  Tribunal\\'s decision and written statement   Written statement o[decision  (1) Where the Tribunal makes its decision on a review (other than an oral decision), the Tribunal must make a written statement that:  (a) sets out the decision of the Tribunal on the review: and  (b) sets out the reasons for the decision: and  (c) sets out the findings on any material questions of fact,· and  (d) refers to the evidence or any other material on which the findings of fact were based;· and  (e) in the case o[a decision under paragraph 426A(1C)(b) or subsection 426A(1E)to confirm the dismissal of an application--indicates that under subsection 426A (1F). the decision under review is taken to be affirmed,· and   (f) records the day and time the statement is made.  PARTICULARS  (a) The delegate referred to extensive Country Information concerning the Basij. This included:  • There is reportedly a Basij presence in every city and town in Iran;  • Arbitrary arrest and detention is legislated against but still commonly occurs;   • Arbitrary arrest and detention is often carried out by the Basij;   • Forced confessions have also been widely reported and are often used in court;   • Often plain clothes officers arrived at homes or offices and conducted raids without warrants or other assurances or due process, confiscating private documents, passports, computers, electronic media, and other personal items and arresting individuals\" [CB 103-104];  • (From a 2012 source) arbitrary arrest and detention ......... are increasingly employed:\\' [CB104].  (b) The findings of the AAT as described above under Ground 1 (iii)(g) were inconsistent with the available country information. Given the drastic departure from the Country cited by the delegate, the AAT was required by s 430 to give reasons for those findings, including reasons as to why the country information was not accepted.  Mr Hodges, the solicitor for the applicant, abandoned grounds 1 and ground 3.  The reference in ground 4 to ground 1(3)(g) is as follows:   (g) The AA T placed undue weight [39-42] on the inability of the applicant to describe documents that \"would normally\" [39 for example] be given in relation to official actions. The reasoning involving the lack of documents is made without evidence of the processes in Iran. The assumptions are based on legal processes in Australia. In particular, the reasoning pays no regard, even in Iran, to the discrete operations of the state police and religious police (basij). In relation to ground 2, the Court was taken to the finding of the delegate at CB106, as follows:  I accept the applicant had an argument with a Basij officer in his shop and stated that he did not believe in Islam or the supreme leader. I also accept it is possible the Iranian authorities confiscated his laptop which contained some political caricatures and satirical material Relevantly, the delegate continued:  I consider that the argument he had with the Basij officer and the possibility the Basij found some politically satirical material on his laptop is not sufficient to attract the attention of the Iranian authorities if he were to return. Reference was also made to the country information referred to by the delegate at CB103 under the heading “the Basij”:  Country information indicates that the Basij is a widespread paramilitary group which is organised under and extremely loyal to the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC).4 The Basij are used by the Islamic regime for intelligence gathering purposes and to implement security measures, there is reportedly a Basij presence in every city and town in Iran’s Country information also indicates that while arbitrary arrest and detention in Iran is legislated against it still commonly occurs and is often carried out by members of the Basij and that forced confessions have also been widely reported and are used as evidence in court.6  Specifically, the USSD Report 2011 states:  \"Although the constitution prohibits arbitrary arrest and detention, these practices continued during the year [2011]. Moreover, arbitrary arrest was a common practice and was used by authorities to spread fear and deter activities deemed against the regime. Often plainclothes officers arrived unannounced at homes or offices and conducted raids without warrants or other assurances of due process, confiscating private documents, passports, computers, electronic media, and other personal items and arresting individuals.  7  In addition, the Freedom House Report \\'Freedom in the World 2012 - Iran stated the following:  \"arbitrary arrest and detention _ ... are increasingly employed, and family members of detainees are often not notified for days or weeks. Suspected dissidents are frequently held in unofficial, illegal detention centers. Prison conditions in general are notoriously poor, and there are regular allegations of abuse, rape, torture, and death in custody.  Mr Hodges, the solicitor for the applicant, then referred to the finding of the Tribunal at paras.35 and 36, relevantly, as follows:  35. ...The Tribunal finds it implausible that if the authorities were sufficiently concerned about his actions to search his house, seize his laptop and arrest his brother they would not have issued some documentation in relation to that or to authorise his arrest or require him to attend court.  36. On the evidence before it the Tribunal does not accept the applicant argued publicly with a member of the Basij or any other person in his barber shop or say Islam was dead, that he did not believe in Islam or that Khomeini and Khamenei were not good people. The Court was also taken to the finding in the last two sentences of para.43:  43. ...On the evidence before it the Tribunal does not accept there is a warrant for the applicant’s arrest, any documentation requiring him to attend court or that there is any ongoing investigation in relation to him. For all the reasons set out above the Tribunal finds the applicant’s claims about the search of his house, the seizure of his laptop and his brother’s arrest illogical and implausible and does not accept that these events took place. In relation to the applicant’s credibility, the Tribunal said:  22. The Tribunal finds the applicant has been a credible witness with respect to his personal circumstances: his evidence on these matters has been consistent, direct and logical. In contrast his evidence regarding the claimed argument with the Basiji and subsequent events has been less direct, relying almost entirely on claims that he did not know what had happened after he had left and his family had not found out or not told him. In the Tribunal’s view his evidence about this has been illogical and casts significant doubt on the credibility of these claims. It is clear from what was said in para.3 of the Tribunal’s reason that the Tribunal was alive to the finding made by the delegate, accepting that the applicant had argued with the Basij.  It is also clear from the reference by the Tribunal to the delegate’s finding in relation to credibility that it was the argument in relation to the Basij that had been explored by the Tribunal and that this was a claim in which there was doubt as to the credibility of the applicant.   I accept the first respondent’s submission that it is clear from reference to paras.33, 34, 36, 38 and 42 that the applicant’s credibility in relation to the argument with the Basij was a live issue before the Tribunal.  Indeed, the solicitor for the applicant conceded that the questioning referred to in those paragraphs did support the issue of that argument with the Basij member and related events were a live issue before the Tribunal.  I am satisfied that the argument with the Basij and the alleged events of search of the applicant’s family home, seizure of his laptop and arrest of his brother were clearly flagged by the Tribunal as live issues to the applicant and that there is no substance in the alleged jurisdictional error raised by ground 2.  Ground 2 fails to make out any jurisdictional error. In relation to ground 4, the solicitor for the applicant developed the argument on the basis of the illogicality of the assumption by the Tribunal that there must have been some documentation in the reasoning of the Tribunal which reflected the rejection of the applicant’s credit and the finding that there had been no argument with the Basij and no search of his house, seizure of his laptop or arrest of his brother.  The solicitor for the applicant also put that the country information referred to by the Tribunal in para.41 was not the more recent country information as referred to at CB104 by the delegate as quoted above. It is clear from para.73 of the Tribunal’s reasons that the Tribunal did take into account the country information relating to arbitrary arrest and detention. Paragraph 73 is as follows:  73. Country information cited by the delegate in her decision, a copy of which was provided by the applicant to the Tribunal indicates that arbitrary arrest and detention continues to occur in Iran as a means of deterring anti-Islamic activities.13 She has also referred to country information which indicates that the profile of individuals targeted by the Iranian government includes politicians, human rights and student activists, writers, academics, lawyers, journalists, bloggers and family members of high profile or reformist politicians and those who have participated in public protests since 2009.14 The Tribunal finds the applicant’s profile does not place him in any of the categories noted.  The footnotes in para.73 relevantly include reference to the footnote material in the quote by the delegate at CB104 referred to above.  Accordingly, there is no substance in the contention that the Tribunal failed to have regard to the most recent country information.   It was a matter for the Tribunal to determine the applicant’s credit.  The proposition that the Tribunal’s reasoning as to the absence of documentation being illogical is, in my opinion, flawed.  It is apparent that the applicant’s claimed incident was one in which it was open to the Tribunal to raise with the applicant the absence of documentation relating to the search of the family home, the seizure of his laptop and the arrest of his brother.   It cannot be said that no reasonable person could have reasoned that the documentation was relevant to an assessment of the applicant’s credit given the surrounding circumstances which included the applicant being unable to tell the Tribunal which organisation was responsible for the claimed search of his family home, seizure of his laptop or his brother’s arrest.   The solicitor for the applicant sought to argue that there were reasons why the family may have been apprehensive in not providing information to the applicant about those responsible for those activities.  This was, however, a matter for the Tribunal to determine in evaluating the applicants credit. To the extent that it suggested that the Tribunal had to make express reference to the most recent country information in the context of its reasoning about documentation, I reject that contention.  The Tribunal’s reasons are to be read as a whole.  There was no failure by the Tribunal to give adequate reasons within the meaning of s.430 of the Migration Act 1958.  In relation to the finding that the events involving the argument with the Basij, the search of the applicant’s house, seizure of his laptop and arrest of his brother did not occur, I do not accept that the Tribunal proceeded on an assumption based on legal processes in Australia in the reasoning identified by the Tribunal.  No jurisdictional error of the kind alleged in ground 4 is made out.  The amended application is dismissed.  I certify that the preceding twenty-one (21) paragraphs are a true copy of the reasons for judgment of Judge StreetAssociate:  Date: 5 November 2015       ',\n",
       " 'BMO15 v Minister for Immigration & Anor [2015] FCCA 2909 (28 October 2015)': \"  This is an application for a Constitutional writ within the Court’s jurisdiction under s.476 of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) in relation to a decision of the Tribunal made on 26 June 2015 affirming the decision of the delegate not to grant the applicant a protection visa.  The applicant was found to be a national of Bangladesh, and that country was also treated at the receiving country for the purposes of consideration of complementary protection.  The applicant arrived in Australia on 15 June 2012 as a direct offshore entry person.  The applicant claimed to fear harm or persecution due to his imputed political opinion and as a member of a particular social group, namely, people who refuse to join a political party in Bangladesh.  The applicant claimed to have left Bangladesh because he claimed he would have been required to join one of the Bangladesh political parties and involve himself in fighting between rival parties.   A group of unidentified people whom the applicant suspects were members of the underground political party called the Sarbahara Party kidnapped the applicant in December 2011 and took him to a field at his home for two hours and asked him to join the Awami League party and threatened to kill him if he did not join.  The applicant said he agreed to join the Awami League party but then decided he had to leave, as otherwise he would have to follow the party’s commands if he stayed and would have had to harass and make trouble for supporters of the other party, including some of his family members.   The applicant said that after he had left Bangladesh, somebody came looking for him and destroyed some of his family’s crops, and claimed there was violence in his home village over political issues and some people were killed there.  The applicant claimed that his family fled for two or three months, and on return their crops were destroyed again, and the applicant claimed that his family had to pay a bribe to the BNP opposition to return to the land.   The applicant fears returning to Bangladesh, as he fears he will be killed or continually harassed by these parties because of his imputed political opinion if he joins one party or does not join the other, and as being a member of a particular social group as a person who refuses to join one of the political parties.   On 20 August 2015, a Registrar of the Court made orders providing an opportunity for the applicant to file an amended application, affidavit evidence and submissions.  The applicant filed an amended application that raises the following grounds:  1. The Refugee Review Tribunal made a jurisdictional error when it failed to consider each integer of his claim and or failed to taken into account the whole of the oral and written evidence in determining whether he feared persecution claimed amounted to persecution and serious harm within the meaning ofs 91 R of the Migration Act.   Particular : The applicant gave the evidence why he is targated by the Awami League Party workers ad supporters and why the Awami League Party wanted him to join the the party and work for them. It is obvious that he was very popular man among the Muslim community as well as in the Hindu population in that area. He was one being a Muslim fouhght for the Hindu community. That was one intger why the Awami League Party wanted him to join. The Tribunal failed to account this matter and mistook the facts.  The applicant claims that the Tribunal failed to consider more recent information with regards to the attacks on the BNP supporters by the member and supporters of the Awami League Party.   The applicant claims that not considering the recent information about the atrocities committed by the Awami League on the BNP supporters is an error or a path leading to error , error is itself is failure to perform the statutory task imposed on the Tribunal by the Migration Act.  In a case Minister for Immigration and Border Protection v MZYTS [2013] FCAFC 114;  (2013) 136 ALD 547 at 34 Hon Judge Kenny, Griffith and Mortimer JJ stated: the task involves:  [F]irst, correct understanding of the basis on which the visa applicant says she or he has fear of persecution in he or his country of nationality and second, a correct understanding of how, in respect   Of each of the of the bases articulated, it is to be determined whether that fear is objectively well founded  That task could not be lawfully undertaken without “a consciousness and consideration of the submission, evidence and material advanced by the visa applicant most likely to give the Tribunal a accurate picture of the ongoing circumstances on the ground in Zimbabwe for him if he were to be returned there” [38]  2. The Tribunal made a jurisdictional error when it discared all the oral and written submission without giving any solid evidence of cumulative credibility concern in the finding of reasons. d mind.   Particular :  In the decision the RRT found that there were some inconsistency between he gave at the Tribunal hearing and his written claims and the statements he made at the protection interview. at Immigration Detention Centre , which was included in the Departmental file . Applicant claims that he misunderstood and responded to the questions posed by the Tribunal in a situation of nerviousness and distress . The Tribunal ignored the actual court proceeding process .  It is natural when the applicant is called for expansion of his grounds in hearing the applicant gives more evidnce to justify his/ her claim and during that time it is natural that being a non-legal person speaks whatever comes in mind at the hearing time. The Tribunal totally misconstrued the facts . Whatever the applicant said in support of his claim was true . The Tribunal did not assess the applicant's evidence according to section 424 of the Migration Act.  2. The Refugee Review Tribunal made a jurisdictional error when it did not apply real test of persecution and harm according to the Migration Act  Particulars  The Tribunal raised several irrelevant issues to discredit the oral and written evidence of the applicant . He said that he has no reasonable protection from the local authorities . He claims that the RRT did not account the applicant's claim that there is no reasonable protection from the Bangladesh Government. ..  The Tribunal failed to apply the correct test in relation to the complementary Protection Provision contained in section 36(2)(aa) of the Migration Act 1958. The Tribunal  made a jurisdictional error when it did not follow Rules of Real Risk Test or persecution and harm.   Particulars  The RRT ignored the relevant consideration related with complementary Protection set out ins 36(2) (aa).  The harm or the mistreatment feared by the applicant on return is for reason of one or more of five grounds of recognized in the Refugee Convention.  Applicant's fear of harm is well-founded and that there is a real chance that he will suffer persecution if he returned to Bangladesh. As the applicant stated in the Primary application if he is compelled to go back to his country he will be k1lled by the Awami League Party workers and he has genuine protection from Bangladesh Governement as Awami League Party Govenring the nation. In accordance with the statutory regime, a letter by the Tribunal dated 9 December 2014 invited the applicant to appear on 2 February 2015 to give evidence and present arguments.  The applicant appeared on that date by video to give evidence and present arguments and was assisted by an interpreter and was represented, albeit by telephone, by his registered migration agent.  Prior to the hearing on 28 January 2015 submissions were provided to the Tribunal on behalf of the applicant, and those submissions were clearly referred to by the Tribunal in para.34, as well as para.35. The submissions included reference to country information and advanced reasons why it was said the applicant had not embellished his claims.  The Tribunal set out the relevant law in its reasons in paras.18 to 20, relevantly identifying the real chance test in relation to whether the applicant had a well-founded fear of persecution, as well as identifying, in relation to complementary protection, the issue of whether there would be a real risk that the applicant will suffer significant harm. The Tribunal made adverse findings in relation to the applicant’s credibility, relevantly, in para.52, as follows:  52. For all the above reasons, considered cumulatively the Tribunal does not find the applicant to be a credible, truthful and reliable witness. The Tribunal is of the view that the applicant has fabricated claims and concocted evidence to achieve an immigration outcome.  On the basis of the above cumulative credibility concerns the Tribunal therefore does not accept that the applicant is a credible witness and cannot be satisfied on the evidence before it that the applicant is a truthful witness as to his claims. Relevantly, the Tribunal found:  62. Similarly based on my findings above and on the information before me I am therefore not satisfied on the basis of the evidence before me that there is a real risk that he will suffer significant harm on his return to Bangladesh at the hands of the Awami League, BNP or any other political party or anyone acting for them as he is not a member of a political party or refuses to join one or because he will be forced to join the BNP or Awami League.   63. It follows from the credibility findings above the Tribunal does not accept were he to return to Bangladesh that either he or his family will have to pay a bribe to the Awami League or BNP or any political party, that either he or his brother will not be paid wages as they did not join a political party or bribe to a political party or that the wages he earns are not sufficient to support the family. It follows from the evidence above it does not accept his brother, [X] is not working and that he will have to solely provide for the family. It follows from the credibility findings above that I do not accept that these reasons or any other will threaten his ability to support and sustain himself, including his family, in Bangladesh. I  therefore do not accept that the applicant will be unable to subsist in Bangladesh analogous to the examples of serious harm outlined in Section 91R(2) nor that he will face such difficulties on his return, which would constitute serious harm under s.91R(1)(b). Further based on the evidence before me I do not accept that the difficulties he claims he will face this regard meets the definition of ‘Significant harm’ as exhaustively defined in s.36(2A) and s.5(1).  64. It follows the Tribunal is not satisfied that he faces a real chance of persecution involving serious harm as he will be unable to subsist or support and sustain himself, including his family, were he to return to Bangladesh in the reasonably foreseeable future as he will not join a political party, due to the level of bribes he will have to pay, as wages are not paid to those who are not members of political parties or if he had to join a party he would not be able to earn money to support himself and his family or for any of the reasons he claims.  65. It follows on the basis of its findings of fact that I do not accept that there are substantial grounds for believing that, as a necessary and foreseeable consequence of the applicant being removed from Australia to Bangladesh, there is a real risk that he will suffer significant harm as defined in subsection 36(2A) of the Migration Act as he will be unable to subsist or support and sustain himself, including his family, were he to return to Bangladesh in the reasonably foreseeable future as he will not join a political  party, due to the level of bribes he will have to pay or if he had to join a party he would not be able to earn money to support himself and his family or for any of the reasons he claims.  ...  67. It follows on the basis of its findings of fact that I do not accept that there are substantial grounds for believing that, as a necessary and foreseeable consequence of the applicant being removed from Australia to Bangladesh, there is a real risk that he will suffer significant harm as defined in subsection 36(2A) of the Migration Act from hooligans, members of BNP or Awami League or anyone else because of his claimed involvement in working with and protecting Hindus.  ...  69. ... The Tribunal is therefore not satisfied on the evidence before that he faces a real chance of persecution involving serious harm for one or more of the Convention reasons were he to return to Bangladesh in the reasonably foreseeable future as the Awami League and BNP or any other political party clash politically and there is sometimes incidental or random violence as a result.  70. On the basis of the independent information before it the Tribunal finds that such random and incidental violence as a result of political clashes or protests happens from time to time in Bangladesh and finds that it happens throughout the country as a whole and is not confined to any area. It is faced by the population generally and not the applicant personally. The Tribunal therefore finds that there is not a real risk that the applicant will suffer significant harm in Bangladesh as the risk is faced by the population of the country generally and is not faced by the applicant personally, as outlined in s.36(2B) of the migration Act.  71. The Tribunals therefore does not accept that there are substantial grounds for believing that, as a necessary and foreseeable consequence of the applicant being removed from Australia to Bangladesh, there is a real risk that he will suffer significant harm as the Awami League and BNP or any other political party clash politically and there is sometimes incidental or random violence as a result.  Conclusions regarding the Refugees Convention   72. The Tribunal has considered whether the combination of each of the individual claims raised by the applicant and his agent would together create a real chance of him being subjected to serious harm in Bangladesh in the reasonably foreseeable future.  Having carefully considered the cumulative effect of these factors and attributes in light of the information and evidence before it, and given its reasons in relation to each factor, the Tribunal does not accept that there is a real chance the applicant would face serious harm for these reasons if he returns in the reasonably foreseeable future.    73. Based on all the evidence before it, including the applicant’s claimed past circumstances and what is accepted of his current personal and family circumstances and profile in Bangladesh, the Tribunal is not satisfied that the applicant faces a real chance of serious harm for any of the reasons claimed or arising on the evidence, either singularly or cumulatively, for a Convention reason, in the reasonably foreseeable future. It follows that the Tribunal is not satisfied that the applicant faces a well-founded fear of persecution in Bangladesh for a Convention reason in the reasonably foreseeable future. Accordingly, the Tribunal is not satisfied that the applicant is a refugee under section 36(2) (a) of the Act.   Complementary Protection  74. The Tribunal has also considered whether the applicant is eligible for complementary protection. Findings have been made above in this regard.  I have also considered the information as raised by the applicant’s representative at the Department interview, submissions and Tribunal hearing. It was in those circumstances the Tribunal found that the applicant was not a person in respect of whom Australia has protection obligations and that the criteria under ss.36(2)(a) and 36(2)(aa) was not made out. In relation to ground 1 of the amended application, it is clear from the findings referred to above in paras.61 and 62 that the Tribunal took into account the applicant’s claim of fear of being targeted by the Awami League party and that it cannot be said that this was an integer of the applicant’s claim that the Tribunal failed to address.  Insofar as ground 1 refers to alleged failure by the Tribunal to take into account more recent information, no such information is identified and it is clear from the Tribunal’s reasons, to which I have referred, that the country information provided in the applicant’s submissions was taken into account by the Tribunal.   There is no substance in the assertion that the Tribunal failed to consider recent information and ground 1 fails to make out any jurisdictional error.   Ground 2 is, in substance, an impermissible challenge to the adverse findings of credit by the Tribunal that were open on the material before the Tribunal.  The Tribunal provided reasons for the adverse findings of credit and those adverse findings cannot be said to lack an evident and intelligible justification.  It is also clear that the applicant’s credit was a live issue before the Tribunal and it is apparent from the Tribunal’s reasons that the Tribunal put to the applicant concerns in relation to the applicant’s credibility in relation to his claims and evidence.  It is clear from the reasons of the Tribunal that the Tribunal had regard to the information provided by the applicant and to the country information referred to in the reasons by the Tribunal and there is no substance in the contention of any breach of s.424 of the Migration Act 1958. In relation to ground 3, it is clear that the Tribunal correctly identified the real-chance test in relation to the issue of the applicant’s alleged genuine fear of persecution and that the Tribunal applied that test in the adverse findings, relevantly, in paras.72 and 73 that referred to real chance.  It is equally clear that the Tribunal identified the real-risk test in relation to significant harm in respect of complementary protection and that test was correctly applied relevantly in para.75 of the Tribunal’s reasons. There is no substance in the assertion in ground 3 that the Tribunal failed to apply the correct test, either in relation to s.36(2)(a) or in relation to s.36(2)(aa).  In substance, the particulars, which refer to the adverse findings in relation to complementary protection, appear to be an impermissible challenge to those adverse findings that were open to the Tribunal.  Ground 3 fails to make out any jurisdictional error. From the bar table, the applicant identified that he had not been believed by the delegate or the Tribunal and maintained that he told the truth and that it was very risky for him to go back and that his life would be at risk and that he would be killed.  The applicant maintained that he was not safe anywhere in his own country and that he wanted to help the government here and do something for other persons in his position.   This Court does not have jurisdiction to make fresh findings of fact and is confined in relation to the application for relief to determination of whether or not there was a jurisdictional error by the Tribunal or a denial of procedural fairness in the conduct of the review.  Nothing said by the applicant identifies any arguable jurisdictional error or any arguable issue of denial of procedural fairness.  As indicated earlier in the reasons given, the issue of credit was an issue for the Tribunal to determine.  Nothing said by the applicant identified any arguable jurisdictional error.

       " 'Bhatia v Minister for Immigration & Anor [2015] FCCA 1512 (26 June 2015)': \"  This is an application for judicial review of a decision of the Migration Review Tribunal (“the Tribunal”) made 7 April 2014 affirming a decision of the Minister’s Delegate not to grant the applicant a Skilled Residence (Class VB) visa (“the visa”). The application discloses eight grounds of complaint, each dealt with below. The applicant appears in person before this Court. He did not provide written submissions but did offer some short oral submissions in support of his application. Upon the matter being called on, the applicant made an oral application for an adjournment. The Minster had been put on notice as to the application. That application was heard and refused with short separate reasons given. The substantive application for relief is opposed. The Minister has provided written submissions. Background  The applicant is from India. He applied for a visa on 28 January 2009. He nominated pastry cook as his skilled occupation. In support he submitted a pre-migration skills assessment application. The assessment was granted inter alia on a reference from Bakers Hut in Glenroy dated 26 March 2008 and comprehensive in its content.  On 4 January 2012 the Department requested further, specific and more detailed information from the applicant. On 5 January 2012 the Department again wrote to the applicant advising him in respect of public interest criterion (PIC) 4020 and that the information submitted to Trades Recognition Australia (TRA) in support of the skills assessment was false in content and that the assessment had been fraudulently obtained. The letter invited the applicant to comment. The applicant responded on 28 January 2012 providing a copy of his submission of 28 January 2011 to the visa case officer and inclosing a letter of 14 January 2011 from a Psychologist apparently corroborating his work experience at the bakery together with pay slips, a written reference from Yam Yam Café and Bakery dated 22 January 2012 and his curriculum vitae details. The Delegate refused the visa application on 4 February 2012 and the applicant lodged an application for a review before the Tribunal on 20 February 2012. The Tribunal invited the applicant to appear before it on 31 July 2013. On 15 August 2013 the Tribunal affirmed the Delegates decision. On 14 November 2013 a consent order was made quashing that decision by Writ of Certiorari. The application was remitted to the Tribunal for re-hearing.  The second Tribunal hearing was listed for 6 February 2014. The applicant was again invited to attend and did so represented by his migration agent.  Prior to the hearing the applicant, through his representative, provided a request for access to Departmental and MRT files pursuant to s.362A of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) (“the Act”). The Tribunal’s reasons at [10] also disclose that the Tribunal summoned the following on 6 February 2014: All associated Departmental files and copies of all evidence (TRIM and ISCE recorded, file notes, investigation reports etc) that lead to the Delegate’s finding that the applicant’s work reference from Bakers Hut may have been fraudulently issued to him; Any document or record that confirms that the Applicant’s work reference from Mr Deniz Kordemiar of Bakers Hut was found in the possession of (the informant) as a result of the search warrant executed at (the informant’s) residential premises and that his work reference was a Court exhibit in the proceedings brought against (the informant); Any document or record that confirms that the applicant’s work reference was similar in content and format to any false work references found in the possession of (the informant) as a result of the search warrant executed at his residential premises. On 21 February 2014 the Tribunal wrote to the applicant inviting comment or response to the various information which implicated a person in the creation of false information or bogus documents contemporaneous to and from the facility which offered the applicant’s reference. The information disclosed the seizure of a USB memory stick. That information further implicated the owner of Bakers Hut. (There have been, and perhaps continue to be, proceedings in the County Court of Victoria in relation to the person from whom the USB stick and other evidence was allegedly obtained. The presiding Judge has made injunctive orders in respect of the publications of certain material from those proceedings. Although I am uncertain as to the intended limitations of those Orders, I will not name the person in these reasons but rather refer to him at all times as “the informant”). On 31 March 2014 the applicant’s migration agent respondent at length. (CB 235).  On 9 April 2014 the Tribunal advised the applicant of its decision made 7 April 2014 affirming the Delegates decision not to grant the visa. The Tribunal’s Decision.  At [25] the Tribunal correctly identified the issue as:The issue in this review is whether the visa applicant meets Public Interest Criterion 4020 (PIC 4020) as required by cl.886.225 for the grant of the visa. Broadly speaking, this requires that:  there is no evidence that the applicant has given, or caused to be given, to the Minister, an officer, the Tribunal, a relevant assessing authority, or Medical officer of the Commonwealth, a bogus document or information that is false or misleading in a material particular in relation to the application for the visa or a visa that the applicant held in the 12 months before the application was made: PIC 4020(1); and the applicant and each member of the family unit have not been refused a visa because of a failure to satisfy PIC 4020(1) in the period commencing 3 years before the application was made to the present: PIC 4020 (2). At [26-33] the Tribunal identified the requirements of PIC 4020. At [41] the Tribunal detailed the information before it. At [42-44] the Tribunal observed:In view of the question posed by subclause 4020(1), the Tribunal considers that it is appropriate to contemplate the information before it having regard to the context of all the surrounding circumstances relating to the applicant’s claimed work experience at Bakers Hut. This is because such circumstances provide a background that assists in the objective assessment of the relevant information before the Tribunal.  At [45] and following the Tribunal noted factors giving probity to the information including: i) That the informant had made admissions as to fraudulent conduct resulting in a criminal Court conviction in 2011;ii) Those admissions implicated Bakers Hut in respect of a false work reference [46]; iii) Other links between the applicant and the informant including an admission by the applicant of his direct approach to the informant seeking work experience and the informant referral of the applicant to Bakers Hut. Further, the period of the informant’s admitted criminal behaviour coincided in time with the applicant’s work experience at Baker Hut; iv) The applicant’s work reference was located on the USB memory stick seized from the informant’s residence [49] and identified in substance as the applicant’s submitted work reference [50] albeit in different wording and style.  At [51] the Tribunal noted the applicant’s claim that his employer kept a record of his hours in a log book but such records had not been produced. However, at [52] the Tribunal accepted that the applicant’s work was unpaid and hence he was not in a position to obtain pay slips or tax statements. The Tribunal at [55-57] consciously engaged and weighed the competing evidence. There followed at [60-64] the Tribunal’s findings of fact and credit culminating at [64] with:As a result, the Tribunal is not satisfied that there is no evidence that the applicant has given, or caused to be given, to the Minister, or an officer of the Department, the Tribunal or a relevant assessing authority a bogus document or information that is false or misleading in a material particular in relation to his application for a subclass 866 visa. Accordingly the Tribunal finds that the applicant does not meet the requirements of paragraph 4020(1)(a).  The Tribunal then, and after the above finding, turned to consider the waiver available under subclause 4020(4) should there be appropriate compelling or compassionate circumstances. The Tribunal’s reasons reference well known authorities and the Tribunal properly notes, there being no statutory definition of “compassionate or compelling”, such circumstances are a question of fact in each case.  In this respect the Tribunal noted the applicant’s relationship with his brother and the brother’s own circumstances. It noted in the period during which the applicant had been in Australia [70]. The Tribunal also had before it and considered a psychological assessment of the applicant [71]. At [72] the Tribunal found:Based on the evidence before it, the Tribunal is not satisfied that these circumstances reach an appropriate threshold as to amount to compelling circumstances affecting the interests of Australia, or compassionate or compelling circumstances affecting the interests of an Australian citizen, Australian permanent resident or eligible New Zealand citizen justifying the grant of the visa. Accordingly, the Tribunal has determined not to waive the requirements in subclause PIC 4020(1). The Application before this Court.  Ground 1- the MRT made an error of law, procedure and failed to accord natural justice to the Applicant in that the materials summoned by the MRT as per paragraph 10, 19 and 21 of the Decision Record were not disclosed to the Applicant prior to the Hearing so the Applicant may rebut and comment on such materials. The Tribunal’s reasons disclose that the hearing took place on 6 February 2014. The materials were requested by the Applicant on 21 January 2014 the summons issued on the day of the hearing being 6 February 2014. The materials were received post the hearing on 17 and 21 February 2014. The Tribunal then invited comment from the applicant pursuant to s.359A of the Act and hence complied with the Tribunal’s natural justice obligations. Those invitations were issued on 21 February and 17 March 2014. The Tribunal’s compliance with the provisions of s.359A of the Act discharge its natural justice obligations given that the division is an exhaustive statement of the requirements for natural justice pursuant to s.357A. The information provided in the summons material post hearing was not “new” in that the issue of the informant’s alleged involvement in respect of false work reference was an issue prior to the hearing and one made known to the applicant and indeed one which elicited a response from the applicant prior to the hearing. As the High Court observed in Minister for Immigration and Citizenship v SZKTI[1] at [51]Whether an issue must be raised with an applicant for the purposes of a further hearing under s 425(1) will depend on the circumstances of each case. Matters may arise requiring an invitation to a further hearing. However, that is not the case in the present matter. Here, Mr Cheah's evidence was additional evidence about an extant issue; it did not constitute the raising of a new or additional issue such as to trigger the obligation to give another hearing. This distinguishes the facts here from those considered in SZBEL... Further, s 422B of the Act suggests that there is no residual procedural fairness requirement to give another hearing extraneous to Div 4 of Pt 7. If there were any extraneous right to procedural fairness, as suggested by the first respondent, there was no breach of the obligation here. Importantly, the first respondent had an opportunity to deal with Mr Cheah's information by responding (as he did) to the letter from the RRT conforming with s 424A.  Consequently, I am not satisfied that the applicant has made out Ground 1 of the complaint in that he was denied natural justice. Ground 2- The MRT made an error of law in failing to place weight on the evidence as per Paragraph 24 of the Decision Record that the Applicant’s work reference letter and the work reference letter seized by DIBP were different. The Tribunal’s reasons at [24] state:On 31 March 2014, the applicant’s representative provided applicant’s comments on or response to information contained in the Tribunal’s letter of 17 March 2014, stating that the information concludes that the work reference letter submitted to the Department and the one seized during the search warrant are not identical in format and content. The applicant’s representative reiterated arguments contained in his submissions of 8 March 2014; stated that it is possible for the Tribunal to conclude that (the informant) drafter a number of work reference letters for bakers Hut and that the employer simply used the same draft work reference letter to give to the review applicant (Tribunal folios 111 and 112). He further submitted on (the informant’s) USB memory stick, was different to the one provided to the Department.  It is well established that the attributing of weight to evidence is a function to the determiner of fact being, in this case, the Tribunal in its process of making findings of fact and credit.[2] The wording of [24] is not strictly evidence but rather a statement of the applicant’s submissions. The evidence is the difference in wording or style between the applicant’s own work reference and the “reference” seized on the USB stick. That difference is noted at [50] of the Tribunal’s reasons as follows:The advice received from National Criminal Investigations indicate that details in terms of length and dates of employment, as well as duties performed contained in the work reference letter seized during the warrant, are identical with the details contained in the work reference letter the applicant submitted to the TRA and the Department. Hence, the information contained in the letter submitted to the TRA and the Department was identical to information contained in the wok reference letter found on (the informant’s) USB memory stick that was seized under the search warrant, despite the fact that the work reference letter seized during the warrant is worded different and in a different order in terms of the task performed.  The Tribunal’s consideration of the evidence on this issue continues at [51-64] which is clearly a process of engaging, considering and weighing the competing evidence including that given or adduced by the applicant. In my view, the statement of the evidence at [50] should not be read in isolation but preferably and contextually from paragraph [45] and following where the Court indicates its process of consideration thus:In considering whether the information before the Tribunal has probative value, given the competing account presented by the applicant, the Tribunal notes that there are a number of factors that do support a finding that the information does have probative value.  There follows a consideration of factors for and against the applicant’s claim.  The Tribunal is the determiner of fact and credit. I am satisfied that the Tribunal’s reasons demonstrate an engagement and consideration of all of the evidence including the difference in wording and style in the reference submitted by the applicant to that seized on the USB stick. Ground 3- the MRT made an error of law in determining at Paragraph 16 of the Decision Record that the applicant was already subject to PIC 4020 and moving onto determining whether the applicant could show grounds for a waiver. The MRT should have first assessed whether PIC 4020 applied. [16] of the Tribunal’s reasons says:The Tribunal explained to the applicant the application of public interest criterion 4020 to his case. As a result, the Tribunal invited the applicant to indicate if he had any compelling circumstances that affected the interest of Australia, or any compassionate or compelling circumstances that affected the interests of an Australian citizen, an Australian permanent resident or an eligible New Zealand citizen, justifying the granting of the visa to him  [16] of the Tribunal’s reasons should be read within the proper and total context of the whole reasons. Contrary to the applicant’s assertion, those reasons disclose clearly that the Tribunal firstly and separately considered the requirements of PIC 4020 at [55-64]. A discrete finding in respect of 4020(1)(a) appears at [64] as follows:As a result, the Tribunal is not satisfied that there is no evidence that the applicant has given, or caused to be given, to the Minister, or an officer of the Department, the Tribunal or a relevant assessing authority a bogus document or information that is false or misleading in a material particular in relation to his application for a subclass 866 visa. Accordingly, the Tribunal finds that the applicant does not meet the requirements of paragraph 4020(1)(a).  There then follows a heading “The Waiver in Subclause 4020(4)”. The Tribunal at [65-70] then discretely but in detail address the waiver provisions. Consequently, I reject the applicant’s argument that [16] demonstrates confusion of the obligation to make separate and discrete considerations or that the Tribunal might have reached findings in respect of 4020(1) without proper consideration. It follows that the ground of appeal must fail. Ground 4- The MRT made an error of law in failing to place weight on the matter that applicant was not named by (the informant) as a person for whom fraudulent or bogus documents were prepared. The MRT made this assumption without proper evidence. Under the heading “What is the Information before the Tribunal?” at [41] the Tribunal includes:The fact that the applicant’s work reference from Bakers Hut was marked as “Exhibit Master Number 2 and 9” on a spreadsheet referring to the applicant and work references found on the USB stick seized from (the informant’s) premises under search warrant.  Specifically, the applicant’s argument here is contradicted by evidence before the Tribunal and noted at [49] thus:In addition, not only was the applicant’s 900 hours’ work experience purportedly undertaken with an employer implicated in (the informant’s) fraudulent activities, but a work reference in the applicant’s name from Bakers Hut was found by investigators on the USB memory stick seized from (the informant’s) residence.  The failure of the informant to specifically name the applicant is in my view immaterial in an evidentiary sense or at least isolation. It is clear that the Tribunal considered various pieces of information and evidence both for and against the contentions of the applicant. The Tribunal is the determiner of fact and credit. It is for the Tribunal to attribute weight to the evidence. Secondly, I accept the submission of Counsel of the respondent that at [59] of its reasons the Tribunal correctly observed as to the wording of the section:Notwithstanding the fact that the Tribunal found the applicant to be a generally credible witness at the hearing, the evidence in this case casts doubts upon the nature and duration of the applicant’s claimed work experience at Bakers Hut in 2007/08. In addition, the Tribunal observes that the question posed by subclause 4020(1) requires it to make a “no evidence” finding regarding the matters set out in this provision.  I find no merit in this ground of appeal. Ground 5- The MRT made an error of law in Paragraph 47 of the Decision Record in assuming that simply because the applicant sought assistance from (the informant) for work placement and was recommended Bakers Hut among other employers, the applicant had participated in the provision of bogus documents. [47] or the Tribunal’s reasons states:Secondly, there are also other facets to the information before the Tribunal that link the applicant to the fraudulent activities of (the informant). For example, the applicant stated in his oral evidence that he approached (the informant) seeking help in obtaining work experience required for skills assessment purposes. The applicant was referred to Bakers Hut by (the informant). The applicant also claimed that he undertook his work experience at Bakers Hut from February 2007 to February 2008, which falls well within the period 1 November 2006 to 29 September 2009 when (the informant) engaged in his fraudulent activities.  I do not read [47] as constituting assumptions or findings. Rather, it is demonstrative of the engagement of the Tribunal with the evidence in its consideration. The fact that the paragraph commences with the word “Secondly” is itself indicative of the paragraph being properly read within context rather in isolation. In any event, I do not accept that the paragraph offers any conclusions or assumptions not available to the Tribunal on the evidence. I agree with Counsel for the first respondent that this ground is misconceived and has no merit. Ground 6- The MRT made an error of law at Paragraph 5 of the Decision Record in that the conviction of (the informant) implicated the applicant. The applicant was not part of the County Court proceedings and did not have the opportunity to cross-examine (the informant) in the criminal proceedings and neither was he named by (the informant) in the evidence of documents comprising the criminal proceedings. At [56] the Tribunal says:However, the Tribunal observes that the applicant’s knowledge of the physical location and appearance of Bakers Hut and his subsequent work experience as a pastry chef at Yam Yam Café and bakery, does not necessarily detract from the probative value of the admissions (the informant) made to the Australian authorities, which were ultimately accepted and resulted in his conviction. The Tribunal further notes that (the informant) specifically informed the authorities that many students did take the time to familiarise themselves with the business where they falsely claimed to have completed their 900 hours’ work experience, and that the employers named by him, including Mr Kordemir, were complicit in this fraud.  I am of the view that this ground again is misconceived. It errs in taking one piece of evidence in isolation. The ultimate conviction of the informant is not in dispute. The Tribunal had before it evidence of “links” between the informant and the applicant’s employer and also between the applicant himself and the informant. The Tribunal states that there was evidence both for and against the applicant’s contentions as to his work experience and reference. The circumstances of the informant and his conviction are a part only in the whole of the evidence. I am satisfied that the Tribunal considered all of the evidence and entered into a rational process of consideration leading to findings that were available to it on the evidence as a whole. The fact that the applicant did not have the opportunity to “cross-examine” the informant in the County Court shows a fundamental misunderstanding of the roles various in criminal Courts. I am satisfied that there is no merit to this ground of appeal. Ground 7 - The MRT made an error of law in Paragraph 57 of the Decision Record in that the MRT placed two much weight on circumstantial evidence and suggested that it preferred the evidence and findings of the Department of Immigration and Australian Federal Police. This ground of appeal is again a challenge to the Tribunal’s role in attributing weight to evidence and proceeding to make findings of fact and credit. It is not for this Court to drift into considerations of relative weight of evidence be that circumstantial or otherwise. This is not an argument as to illogicality or unreasonableness in the decision. it is an argument only to the allegations of weight. To this end, this ground of appeal is misconceived and must fail.  Ground 8 – The MRT failed to consider as a matter of Law at Paragraph 70 of the Decision Record that the applicant had a brother in Australia who was a resident and citizen and that he was close to his brother and would be separated if a waiver was not granted. The MRT failed to give sufficient weight to the family relationship, close ties, and distance of separation and likely affects. Again, and in respect of the last sentence of this ground it is for the Tribunal to consider attributing weight to the evidence and in doing so will not fall into error as the finder of fact should the process undertaken be a rational and logical one. The Tribunal at [70] says:In relation to the provisions of paragraph 4020(4) the Tribunal notes that the applicant stated that his brother recently became an Australian citizen who intends to set up a business in Australia and will need the applicant to help him operate the business; that he has a close relationship with his brother who will be adversely affected if the applicant is required to leave Australia. He further stated that he has been in Australia for more than seven years and is well settled in this country.  Further, reference in respect of the applicant’s relationship with his brother appears at [17] of the reasons and, in fact, oral evidence was received from the applicant’s brother as referenced at [18]. [70] appears contextually under the heading “The Waiver in Subclause 4020(4)” and in [65-72] the Tribunal noting authorities properly set out the requirements of “compelling circumstances” and “compassionate or compelling circumstances” I consider the use of the term “notes” at [70] as opposed to the word “considered” at, for example, [71] to be of no significance. The Tribunal’s reasons should and do demonstrate an engagement with the claims and evidence of the applicant as opposed to a mere re-instatement of the claim. I am satisfied that the applicant’s claims in respect of his relationship with his brother were therefore engaged and considered by the Tribunal leading to the finding at [72] beginning with and demonstrated by the phrase “Based on the evidence before it...”. I find no merit in this ground of appeal. Conclusion  I am satisfied that no jurisdictional error infects the Tribunal’s reasons and findings. Consequently, the application will be dismissed with an Order for costs.I certify that the preceding fifty-nine (59) paragraphs are a true copy of the reasons for judgment of Judge McGuireDate: 26 June 2015 [1] [2009] HCA 30;  (2009) 238 CLR 489[2] Minister for Aboriginal Affairs v Peko Wallsend Ltd [1986] HCA 40;  (1986) 162 CLR 24 at  [39-41].       \",\n",
       " 'Buttar v Minister for Immigration & Anor [2015] FCCA 3176 (20 November 2015)': \" (Edited ex tempore Reasons)  Before the Court is an application for judicial review of a decision made by the Migration Review Tribunal (as it then was) (‘the Tribunal’) on 17 April 2015.  The Tribunal affirmed a decision made by a delegate of the First Respondent on 18 December 2013 to refuse to grant the Applicant a Partner Temporary (Class UK) visa (the visa). The grounds of application as contained in the Application are as follows:-  “1. I, Sukhdeep Singh Buttar, Passport Number L1524631, Date of birth 29/01/1985, declare that i (sic) made an application for visa class UK subclass 820(Partner (temporary)), on 16 September 2011.  I received a notice of refusal of visa 18 December 2013, which states that i (sic) did not satisfy the provisions of migration regulations 1994 (The Regulations).  2.  After carefully going through the regulations, i (sic) understood that i (sic) satisfied the related migration regulations.  Then i (sic) lodged the application for review of decision made by Department of Immigration and Border Protection, at Migration Review Tribunal(MRT), with an expect ion(sic) that they will make decision in my favour and provide me justice, But (sic) on 3 July 2014, I was refused the visa again as i (sic) did not appear for hearing.  I had genuine reasons for not appearing at the hearing.  3.   I lodged application in Federal Circuit Court of Australia on 17 September 2014. Then, Honourable Court advised to review the decision of my application to Migration Review Tribunal(MRT).  The hearing date was on 13 April 2015 at Migration Review Tribunal.  The Migration Review Tribunal(MRT) again refused my application on dated (sic) 23 April 2015.  4.  The main reason behind filing this application is that i (sic) believe there was a jurisdiction error in the decision.  I believe that relevant factors were not considered.  I request Federal Circuit Court to please shed some light in my case and provide justice to me.” As can be seen from a reading of the above grounds, there is, in essence, only one ground stated in this Application, which is that the Applicant alleges that relevant factors were, not considered by the Tribunal.  What those relevant factors were he failed to particularise.  When given the opportunity to make oral submissions to the Court this day, the Applicant was unable to provide any particularisation of that claim.  He submitted to the Court that he thought his marriage was over. On 8 July 2015, Registrar Trott made Orders in the proceedings and being Orders by consent.  Included relevantly in those Orders was Order number 4, that the Applicant shall file and serve on or before 23 September 2015:-  “3.1 (sic) an amended application giving particulars of the review; and  3.2 (sic) any further affidavits upon which he intends to rely at the hearing of the matter.” It was further ordered on 8 July 2015 in Order number 7, that the Applicant file and serve an outline of submissions not less than 42 days before the hearing.  The Applicant complied with neither of these Orders. The First Respondent seeks the Applicant’s Application be dismissed and that costs in the sum of $6,000 follow the event.  The First Respondent asserts there is no jurisdictional error attending the decision of the Tribunal.  The Respondent has filed a Court book in the proceedings and the contents of same are evidence before the Court. History  The Applicant is a citizen of India who first arrived in Australia on 15 December 2005 holding a Student visa.  He later left Australia before returning on 15 April 2009 holding a further Student visa. On 8 September 2011, the Applicant married Agel Deng (‘the sponsor’), an Australian citizen at Wagga Wagga in New South Wales.  On 16 September 2011, the Applicant applied for the visa on the basis of his relationship with the sponsor.  At that time, (Class UK) contained only one subclass, Subclass 820 (partner) (temporary).  The criteria for the grant of this visa are set out in Part 820 of Schedule 2 to the Migration Regulations 1994 (Cth) (‘the Regulations’).  The primary criteria must be satisfied by at least one applicant. Other members of the family unit, who are applicants for the visa, need satisfy only the secondary criteria.   On 19 September 2013, the Department of Immigration and Citizenship, now the Department of Immigration and Border Protection (‘the Department’) sent a request to the Applicant for further evidence of his relationship with the sponsor. On 18 December 2013, a delegate of the Minister refused to grant the visa on the basis that the Applicant did not satisfy cl.820.211(2) because the parties did not meet the definition of “spouse” having regard to all the circumstances of the relationship, especially those set out in reg.1.15A of the Regulations. On 10 January 2014, the Applicant applied to the Tribunal for a review of the delegate’s decision.  By letter dated 11 June 2014, the Tribunal invited the Applicant and the sponsor to appear before the Tribunal at a hearing on 2 July 2014 and requested that any additional documents be provided by 25 June 2014.  The Applicant did not respond to the Tribunal’s invitation and did not attend the scheduled Tribunal hearing on 2 July 2014. On 2 July 2014, the Tribunal affirmed the delegate’s decision not to grant the Applicant the visa.  The Tribunal was not satisfied that the Applicant and the sponsor were in a spousal relationship at the time of the visa application having regard to the lack of supporting evidence and the Applicant’s failure to attend the Tribunal hearing.   On 24 July 2014, the Applicant filed an Application in the Federal Circuit Court for a review of the Tribunal’s decision.  On 12 December 2014, Judge Lucev made orders by consent quashing the Tribunal’s decision of 2 July 2014 and remitting the matter to the Tribunal for determination according to law.  The Minister conceded that the Tribunal’s decision was affected by jurisdictional error as the Tribunal failed to give the Applicant the prescribed period of notice of the hearing before the Tribunal in accordance with s.360A(4) of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) (‘the Act’). The Tribunal Hearing  Following remittal, the Tribunal, by letter dated 18 February 2015, invited the Applicant to appear before it at a hearing on 13 April 2015, and requested that any additional documents or information be provided to the Tribunal by 6 April 2015. The Applicant provided no additional documents by that date, but did appear before the Tribunal, differently constituted, on 13 April 2015, to give evidence and present arguments. On 17 April 2015, the Tribunal affirmed the delegate’s decision not to grant the Applicant the visa.  On 13 May 2015, the Applicant filed this Application for review of the Tribunal’s decision of 17 April 2015.  The Application was filed within the requisite time period as specified in s.477(1) of the Act. The Tribunal set out, in paragraph 8 of its Statement of Decision and Reasons (‘the decision record'), that the decision in the present case is whether the Applicant and his spouse are in a spousal relationship.  The Tribunal set out correctly the applicable legislation in paragraphs 9 and 10 of the decision record. The Tribunal said:-  “9.  Clause 820.211(2)(a) and 820.221 require that at the time the visa application was made and at the time of this decision, the applicant is the spouse or de facto partner of an Australian citizen or Australian permanent resident or an eligible New Zealand citizen.  In the present case, the applicant claims to be the spouse of a sponsor who is an Australian citizen.  10. “Spouse” is defined in section 5F of the Act and provides that  a person is a spouse of another where the two persons are in a married relationship.  Persons in a married relationship must be married to each other under a marriage that is valid for the purposes of the Act.  There must be a mutual commitment to a shared life as husband and wife to the exclusion of all others. The relationship must be genuine and continuing, and the couple must live together or must not live separately and apart on a permanent basis; section 5F(2)(a) to (d).  In forming an opinion as to these matters, regard must be had to all of the circumstances of the relationship.  This includes evidence of the financial and social aspects and the nature of the parties’ household and their commitment to each other as set out in rule 1.15A(3) ...” The Tribunal accepted the Applicant and the sponsor were validly married as required by s.5F(2)(a) of the Act.   The Tribunal then went on to consider whether the other requirements for a spousal relationship were met.  Regarding the nature of the Applicant’s and the spouse’s commitment to each other, the Tribunal recorded the Applicant’s evidence at hearing as follows, and as accurately set out in the First Respondent’s submissions, paragraph 26 to 34:-  “26.1. he and his sponsor had met on a train in Perth;  26.2. the sponsor was living in Wagga Wagga at the time and was only in Perth for a week;    26.3. they exchanged phone numbers and communicated regularly by phone until they met up in Brisbane for 3 weeks in December 2010, where the applicant proposed;  26.4. in February/March 2011 the applicant moved to Wagga Wagga to live with the sponsor, and they married in September 2011;  26.5. in February/March 2011 the applicant returned to Perth and signed a lease for accommodation;  26.6. the sponsor and her son arrived in Perth to live with him in April 2012;  26.7. after 6 months he was unable to pay the rent and he broke the lease, at which point the relationship became bitter and he moved in with friends while the sponsor and her son went to live in Sydney;  26.8. in March 2013 he went to Sydney and lived with the sponsor at her brother’s house for about 6 months, after which time his relationship with his wife broke up and he returned to Perth while the sponsor remained in Sydney;  26.9. the applicant had not seen the sponsor since he returned to Perth; and  26.10. at the time of the Tribunal hearing he was good friends with the sponsor and on speaking terms, and they had not divorced, but he was living in Perth and she was living in Sydney.  27. On the basis of the evidence before it, the Tribunal accepted that the applicant and the sponsor were married in Wagga Wagga in September 2011; accepted that they had not seen each other since the latter part of 2013; and was not satisfied that they had a mutual commitment to the relationship; that they draw companionship and emotional support from each other; or that they see the relationship as a long term one.  28 Regarding financial aspects of the relationship, the Tribunal noted there was no evidence of pooled financial resources or shared assets or liabilities.    29 Regarding the nature of the household, the Tribunal referred to the applicant’s evidence at the hearing. The Tribunal also recorded that the applicant had provided a copy of a 1 year lease signed by the applicant which listed him as the tenant, and that the applicant indicated that his wife was unable to sign the lease as she was in Wagga Wagga at the time.  30. The Tribunal noted that there was no corroborating documentation in support of the applicant’s claims that the parties had lived together during the periods claimed and, on the basis of the limited evidence before it, did not accept that the parties had lived together in any of the periods claimed.  31. Regarding the social aspects of the relationship, the Tribunal referred to brief the statutory declarations sworn by friends of the applicant in September 2011 in support of the applicant’s partner visa application.  Based on the brevity of the statements, and the conclusions reached based on limited factual information, the Tribunal did not place any weight on them.  32. The Tribunal also referred to photographs of the applicant and sponsor at their wedding and at the Perth Zoo, which the Tribunal considered did not provide any insight into the genuineness of the relationship.  The Tribunal also referred to the absence of any of the sponsor’s family at the wedding, and was not satisfied in the evidence before it that there was social recognition of the relationship by the applicant’s and sponsor’s family and friends.  33. Given its findings regarding the matters set out in reg 1.15A(3)(a) - (d), the Tribunal was not satisfied that, at the time of application or at the time of decision, the parties were in a spousal relationship, as it was not satisfied that they met the requirements of a married relationship in s 5F(2)(b) - (d) of the Act.  On this basis, the Tribunal found that the applicant did not meet cl 820.211(2)(a) or cl 820.221 of sch 2 to the Regulations.  34. The Tribunal also found that there was no evidence that the applicant met the alternative criteria in cl 820.211(7) - (9) or in cl 820.221(2) and (3) as Sch 2 to the Regulations. Consideration  There is no identification in the application as to the relevant factors which the Applicant asserts were not considered by the Tribunal.  It was clearly open to the Tribunal on the evidence before it to make the findings that it did.  Indeed, it would be difficult to see how it could have reached any other conclusion.  There is nothing unreasonable, illogical or irrational in the Tribunal’s findings and conclusions.  This application is really one of merits review, if it is even that, and of course that is impermissible for the Court.  The Tribunal correctly stated and applied the law.  The Tribunal accorded to the Applicant procedural fairness and complied with the requirements as set out in Division 5 of Part 5 of the Act.  There is no merit to the application and it shall be dismissed with costs in accordance with the scale as set out in the Federal Court Rules 2001 (Cth).I certify that the preceding eighteen (18) paragraphs are a true copy of the reasons for judgment of Judge HartnettAssociate:  Date: 27 November 2015       \",\n",
       " 'Chowdhury & Ors v Minister for Immigration & Anor [2015] FCCA 2981 (6 November 2015)': \"  This is an application made pursuant to s.476 of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) (“the Act”) on 24 April 2014 and amended on 3 July 2015 and further amended on 8 July 2015 seeking review of the decision of the Migration Review Tribunal (“the Tribunal”), now the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, which found on 26 March 2014 that it did not have jurisdiction to review the decision of the Minister’s delegate to refuse Skilled (Provisional) (Class VC) visas (“the visas”) to the applicants. Background  The evidence before the Court is as follows: The bundle of relevant documents filed by the Minister (“the Court Book” – “CB”). The affidavit of Chaofeng Guan, solicitor, made on 3 July 2015. I upheld the Minister’s objections as follows: [8] – [9] of the affidavit was not read on the basis of relevance and the lack of relevant particularity. [10] – [12] of the affidavit was not read on the basis that they are opinion and submissions. The affidavit of Michael van Bockxmeer, “Gateway Engineer”, of 13 August 2014, with annexure, read with no objection. The background relevant to this matter is as follows. On 21 December 2009, Ms Tahmina Chowdhury (“the applicant”), a citizen of Bangladesh, applied for a “Skilled Regional Sponsored” visa. Her husband, the second applicant, and her two children, the third and fourth applicants, applied as her partner and dependent children respectively (CB 1 to CB 21). In her application for the sponsored visa the applicant stated that she was nominated for the visa by “SA  Immigration South Australia” (CB 3.4). The applicants were represented by a registered migration agent in their application (he continues to represent them as a legal practitioner before the Court). They provided contact details of the agent to the department for the purpose of the Minister’s department communicating with them through the agent. Included in these contact details was the agent’s email address (CB 10). The Minister’s department directed correspondence to this email address during the processing of the visa application. For example, the department sent a letter dated 5 April 2013 to this email address (CB 46 to CB 49, see in particular CB 46.4 for the email address to which the letter was sent, which was the same address as notified in the application). The letter invited the applicants’ comments on information obtained by the department that there was no evidence that the applicant had been sponsored by “SA – Immigration South Australia” as had been claimed in the application for the visas (CB 47.3). There is no evidence before the Court now that the applicant, or her agent, replied to this letter. The Minister’s delegate made her decision to refuse the grant of the visa on 2 January 2014 (CB 52 to CB 61). The reason for the refusal of the visa was that there was no evidence before the delegate that the applicant had been nominated for the visa as she had claimed. Such nomination was an essential criterion for the grant of the visa at the relevant time (see in particular cl.487.213 of Schedule 2 to the Migration Regulations 1994 (Cth) (“the Regulations”). In the decision record, the delegate recorded that (CB 60.4):  “On 5 April 2013 you were requested, through your authorised email address, to provide comment to this information. The department has received no response to this request.  To date we have no evidence on file to show that you have been nominated by a State or Territory government agency, I therefore find that you do not meet cl.487.2013.” The evidence before the Court indicates that the delegate’s letter notifying the applicants of the decision was sent by email on 2 January 2014 at 10.29am (CB 50.5), to the email address provided by the applicant in the application for the visa. That is, the agent’s email address (CB 50.4). The evidence of Mr Bockxmeer provides further explanation. An investigation and analysis of the department’s electronic “outgoing mail logs” by Mr Bockxmeer, who relies on his relevant experience and expertise, is that on 2 January 2014 an email was transmitted to the migration agent’s email address and that the transmission was subsequently completed at 10.30am (see [7] – [9] and annexure “MB-1” of Mr Bockxmeer’s affidavit). There is a discrepancy between Mr Bockxmeer’s evidence in relation to the time of successful transmission, as that evidence arose from his investigation of the department’s electronic logs, and what is recorded as the date and time of transmission and the copy of the relevant “extract” of that log reproduced at “MB-1” (“Jan 1 23:29:15”). That discrepancy is explained at [10] of Mr Bockxmeer’s affidavit and arises from the department’s computer system’s reliance on “Coordinated Universal Time” which does not recognise changes to local times as affected by “Daylight Savings Time”:  “All devices that log in the Secure Gateway are set to use the time Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). This is so Daylight Saving Time (DST) switches will have no effect as UTC is based on the time on the Prime Meridian and does not observe DST. Accordingly the Log Extracts shows that the Email was sent on 1 January 2014 at 23:29pm UTC.” The applicants applied to the Tribunal for review of the delegate’s decision on 20 February 2014 (CB 66.4). The applicants nominated the same registered migration agent to represent them (CB 68). A Tribunal officer wrote to the applicants by letter sent to their representative on 10 March 2014 (CB 71 to CB 72). The letter advised that the Tribunal officer considered that the application for the review of the visa decision was not valid as it was not “lodged” within the prescribed period of 21 days from the day on which the applicants were taken to have been notified of the delegate’s decision. The letter explained (at CB 72):  “...The primary decisions were emailed to your authorised recipient on 2 January 2014 and, on the basis that 2 January 2014 was the date on was the date on which you are taken to have been notified, the last day for lodging the applications for review was 23 January 2014. As the applications were not received until 20 February 2014, they appear to be out of time. However, this is a matter which must be determined by a Tribunal Member.” The letter invited their comments on whether valid applications had been made. The applicants’ migration agent replied on 20 March 2014 (CB 73 to CB 74). The response asserted that the relevant statutory and regulatory scheme (s.347(1)(b) of the Act and reg.4.10 of the Regulations) provided that the application for review must be made within 21 days “...after the day on which the notice is received...”. The representative stated that his office had no record of having received the delegate’s email notifying the delegate’s decision on the visa applications. He stated that his office was “closed for Christmas” on 2 January 2014 and he “believed that the notification supposedly sent to us that day must have been bounced back to the case officer’s mail box” (CB 74). The Tribunal found that it did not have jurisdiction to review the delegate’s decision. The Tribunal referred to s.347(1)(b) of the Act and reg.4.10 of the Regulations and found that an application for review of the delegate’s decision had to have been made “...within 21 days after the applicant was notified of the decision in accordance with the statutory requirements” ([3] at CB 78). The Tribunal had regard to the material before it and found that the applicant was notified of the decision by letter dated 2 January 2014 and sent by email to the “authorised recipient” on that day. It was satisfied that the applicant was notified of the decision in accordance with the statutory requirements ([4] at CB 78). The Tribunal had regard to the representative’s submissions and his assertion that there had not been “a valid notification” of the delegate’s decision ([5] at CB 78). The Tribunal considered these submissions ([6] at CB 78):  “The Tribunal has considered this submission but the agent has not explained why he believed the mere fact of his office being closed would result in an email not reaching its destination.  There is nothing in the Department’s file to suggest that the notification email ‘bounced back’ as the agent speculates it may have done.  The Tribunal is satisfied that the letter of notification was transmitted to the correct address on 2 January 2014.  The agent, who is the applicant’s authorised recipient is taken to have received it at the end of that day.” The Tribunal concluded ([7] at CB 78):  “The Tribunal finds that in accordance with s.494C of the Act, the applicant is taken to have been notified of the decision on 2 January 2014.  Therefore the prescribed period within which the review application could be made ended on 23 January 2014.  As the application for review was not received by the Tribunal until 20 February 2014 it follows that the application for review was not made in accordance with the relevant legislation and the Tribunal has no jurisdiction in this matter.” Before the Court  At the final hearing before the Court, the applicants were represented by a solicitor who had also been their migration agent before the Tribunal and the delegate. Leave was sought, and granted, to proceed on an amended application. The grounds of the further amended application are in the following terms:  “1. The second respondent has made a judicial error by failure to find that the applicants had not received the first respondent's delegate's Decision to refuse their application for a Class VC subclass 485 visa and Notice of this Decision on 2 January 2014, and then the applicants should not be deemed as having been notified at the end of 2 January 2014.  Particulars  a) The first delegate's officer claimed that he/she transmitted to the applicants a Notice and Decision Record for their application for a Class VC subclass 485 visa on 2 January 2014. The documents were transmitted to their migration agent as their authorised recipient by email on 2 January 2014, and the email they used to communicate is paulguan@iprimus.com.au.  b) The migration agent checked their mailbox when asked, replying that they had not received these documents on that day, and the documents would be in their mailbox if they received them.  c) The migration agent said that his mailbox was quite reliable, and he had used this email to communicate with the first respondent's officers for all the applications represented by him over many years, and the communication had been successful all the time.  2. The second respondent has made a judicial error by failure to find that the applicants had made their review application in accordance with the statutory time limits and it has jurisdiction to the matter.  Particulars  a) The combined effect of s.347(1)(b) of the Migration Act and r.4.10 of the Migration Regulations requires that the review application to the Second Respondent must be made within 21 days after the applicant was notified of the decision.   b) The applicants got to know that their application for the visa had been refused on 7 February 2015 until her employer advised that her visa had expired and she went about enquring about it.  c) In transmitting the documents to their migration agent, the delegate officer failed to consider that the agent office might still be closed for Christmas on that day.  d) Further, the email might have bounced back, because the agent's mail box was full. No evidence was to show that the delegate had taken extra care to avoid any errors in discharging his/her duty for the special periods.  e) So, the delegate had made an error in transmitting the documents.   f) Pursuant to 497C(7), the applicants were taken to have received the documents on 7 February 2015 taking into account the circumstances.  g) The applicant made their review application to the second respondent on 20 February 2014, and it was still within 21 days after the applicant was notified of the decision.  h) So, the review application was made within the statutory time limits and the second respondent has jurisdiction to the matter.”  [Errors in the original.] The following parts of the statutory and regulatory scheme are relevant to the disposition of the application to the Court: Section 347(1)(b) of the Act:  “(1)  An application for review of an MRTreviewable decision must:   ...  (b)  be given to the Tribunal within the prescribed period, being a period ending not later than:  (i)  if the MRTreviewable decision is covered by subsection 338(2), (3), (3A), (4) or (7A)—28 days after the notification of the decision; or  (ii)  if the MRTreviewable decision is covered by subsection 338(5), (6), (7) or (8)—70 days after the notification of the decision; or  (iii)  if the MRTreviewable decision is covered by subsection 338(9)—the number of days prescribed, in respect of the kind of decision in question prescribed for the purposes of that subsection, after the notification of the decision; ...” Regulation 4.10 of the Regulations:  “4.10 Time for lodgment of applications with Tribunal (Act, s 347)  (1)  For paragraph 347(1)(b) of the Act, the period in which an application for review of an MRTreviewable decision must be given to the Tribunal:  (a)  if the MRTreviewable decision is mentioned in subsection 338(2) or (7A) of the Act—starts when the applicant receives notice of the decision and ends at the end of 21 days after the day on which the notice is received; or  (b)  if the MRTreviewable decision is mentioned in subsection 338 (3) r (3A) of the Act—starts when the applicant receives notice of the decision and ends at the end of 7 working days after the day on which the notice is received; or  (c)  if the MRTreviewable decision is mentioned in subsection 338(5), (6), (7) or (8) of the Act—starts when the applicant receives notice of the decision and ends at the end of 70 days after the day on which the notice is received; or  (d)  if the MRTreviewable decision is prescribed under subsection 338(9) of the Act—starts when the applicant receives notice of the decision and ends at the end of 21 days after the day on which the notice is received.  (2)  However, the period in which an application by a detainee for review of an MRTreviewable decision must be given to the Tribunal:  (a)  in the case of an application for review of a decision of a kind mentioned in subsection 338(4) of the Act—starts when the detainee receives notice of the decision and ends at the end of 2 working days after the day on which the notice is received; or  (aa)  in the case of an application for review of a decision to which paragraph 4.02(4)(f) applies—starts when the detainee receives notice of the decision to refuse to grant the visa mentioned in subparagraph 4.02(4)(f)(ii) and ends at the end of 2 working days after the day on which the notice is received; or  (b)  in any other case—starts when the detainee receives notice of the decision and ends at the end of 7 working days after the day on which the notice is received.   (2A)  For subparagraph 347(1)(b)(iii) of the Act, the prescribed number of days in respect of an MRTreviewable decision prescribed under subsection 338(9) of the Act is 28 days.  Note:       For subparagraph 347(1)(b)(iii) of the Act, there must be a prescribed number of days in respect of kinds of decisions covered by subsection 338(9) of the Act. The prescribed period for applications for review must end not later than the prescribed number of days after notification of the decision.” Sections 494B, 494C, 494D of the Act:  “494B Methods by which Minister gives documents to a person  Coverage of section  (1)  For the purposes of provisions of this Act or the regulations that:  (a)  require or permit the Minister to give a document to a person (the recipient); and  (b)  state that the Minister must do so by one of the methods specified in this section;  the methods are as follows.  (1A)  If a person is a minor, the Minister may use the methods mentioned in subsections (4) and (5) to dispatch or transmit, as the case may be, a document to an individual (a carer of the minor):  (a)  who is at least 18 years of age; and  (b)  who the Minister reasonably believes:  (i)  has daytoday care and responsibility for the minor; or  (ii)  works in or for an organisation that has daytoday care and responsibility for the minor and whose duties, whether alone or jointly with another person, involve care and responsibility for the minor.  Note:       If the Minister gives an individual a document by the method mentioned in subsection (4) or (5), the individual is taken to have received the document at the time specified in section 494C in respect of that method.  (1B)  However, subsection (1A) does not apply if subsection 52(3C) (which relates to giving notifications in the case of combined applications) applies in relation to the minor.  Giving by hand  (2)  One method consists of the Minister (including by way of an authorised officer) handing the document to the recipient.  Handing to a person at last residential or business address  (3)  Another method consists of the Minister (including by way of an authorised officer) handing the document to another person who:  (a)  is at the last residential or business address provided to the Minister by the recipient for the purposes of receiving documents; and  (b)  appears to live there (in the case of a residential address) or work there (in the case of a business address); and  (c)  appears to be at least 16 years of age.  Dispatch by prepaid post or by other prepaid means  (4)  Another method consists of the Minister dating the document, and then dispatching it:  (a)  within 3 working days (in the place of dispatch) of the date of the document; and  (b)  by prepaid post or by other prepaid means; and  (c)  to:  (i)  the last address for service provided to the Minister by the recipient for the purposes of receiving documents; or  (ii)  the last residential or business address provided to the Minister by the recipient for the purposes of receiving documents; or  (iii)  if the recipient is a minor—the last address for a carer of the minor that is known by the Minister.  Transmission by fax, email or other electronic means  (5)  Another method consists of the Minister transmitting the document by:  (a)  fax; or  (b)  email; or  (c)  other electronic means;  to:  (d)  the last fax number, email address or other electronic address, as the case may be, provided to the Minister for the purposes of receiving documents; or  (e)  if the recipient is a minor—the last fax number, email address or other electronic address, as the case may be, for a carer of the minor that is known by the Minister.  When the Minister hands a document by way of an authorised officer  (6)  For the purposes of sections 494C and 494D, a reference in those sections to an act of the Minister includes, if the act is of a kind referred to in subsection (2) or (3) of this section, a reference to an act of the Minister by way of an authorised officer.  Documents given to a carer  (7)  If the Minister gives a document to a carer of a minor, the Minister is taken to have given the document to the minor. However, this does not prevent the Minister giving the minor a copy of the document.  494C  When a person is taken to have received a document from the Minister  (1)  This section applies if the Minister gives a document to a person by one of the methods specified in section 494B (including in a case covered by section 494A).  Giving by hand  (2)  If the Minister gives a document to a person by the method in subsection 494B(2) (which involves handing the document to the person), the person is taken to have received the document when it is handed to the person.  Handing to a person at last residential or business address  (3)  If the Minister gives a document to a person by the method in subsection 494B(3) (which involves handing the document to another person at a residential or business address), the person is taken to have received the document when it is handed to the other person.  Dispatch by prepaid post or by other prepaid means  (4)  If the Minister gives a document to a person by the method in subsection 494B(4) (which involves dispatching the document by prepaid post or by other prepaid means), the person is taken to have received the document:  (a)  if the document was dispatched from a place in Australia to an address in Australia—7 working days (in the place of that address) after the date of the document; or  (b)  in any other case—21 days after the date of the document.  Transmission by fax, email or other electronic means  (5)  If the Minister gives a document to a person by the method in subsection 494B(5) (which involves transmitting the document by fax, email or other electronic means), the person is taken to have received the document at the end of the day on which the document is transmitted.  (6)  Subsection (5) applies despite section 14 of the Electronic Transactions Act 1999.  Document not given effectively  (7)  If:  (a)  the Minister purports to give a document to a person in accordance with a method specified in section 494B (including in a case covered by section 494A) but makes an error in doing so; and  (b)  the person nonetheless receives the document or a copy of it;  then the person is taken to have received the document at the times mentioned in this section as if the Minister had given the document to the person without making an error in doing so, unless the person can show that he or she received it at a later time, in which case, the person is taken to have received it at that time.  494D  Authorised recipient  (1)  If a person (the first person) gives the Minister written notice of the name and address of another person (the authorised recipient) authorised by the first person to do things on behalf of the first person that consist of, or include, receiving documents in connection with matters arising under this Act or the regulations, the Minister must give the authorised recipient, instead of the first person, any documents that the Minister would otherwise have given to the first person.  Note:       If the Minister gives a person a document by a method specified in section 494B, the person is taken to have received the document at the time specified in section 494C in respect of that method.  (2)  If the Minister gives a document to the authorised recipient, the Minister is taken to have given the document to the first person. However, this does not prevent the Minister giving the first person a copy of the document.  (3)  The first person may vary or withdraw the notice under subsection (1) at any time, but must not (unless the regulations provide otherwise) vary the notice so that any more than one person becomes the first person’s authorised recipient.  (4)  The Minister may communicate with the first person by means other than giving a document to the first person, provided the Minister gives the authorised recipient notice of the communication.  (5)  The Minister need not comply with subsection (1), or the requirement in subsection (4) to give a notice, if:  (a)  the authorised recipient is not a registered migration agent (within the meaning of Part 3); and  (b)  the Minister reasonably suspects that the authorised recipient is giving immigration assistance (within the meaning of that Part); and  (c)  the Minister has given the first person a notice, by one of the methods specified in section 494B, stating that he or she does not intend to give the authorised recipient documents as mentioned in subsection (1).” Consideration  Two preliminary matters require note. First, there was no issue raised in this case that the delegate’s notification did not comply with the provisions of s.66 of the Act. Nor is any such failure apparent on the material before the Court. Second, the notification of the delegate’s decision was sent to the applicants’ authorised recipient in compliance with s.494D of the Act. Ground one of the application, as best as it was explained before the Court, asserts that the Tribunal fell into legal error because it failed to find that the applicants had not received the delegate’s notification on 2 January 2014. Further, that the Tribunal should not have found that the applicants were deemed to have received the notification in circumstances where they did not actually receive the notification. There are a number of matters relevant to the answer to this ground. First, the applicants emphasised and relied upon the matter of actual receipt of the notification of the delegate’s decision. It is important to note, contrary to the applicants’ submissions, that the relevant statutory scheme does not rely on actual receipt of the notification of the decision. Rather as long as the Minister, or his delegate, as in this case, follows the various statutory and regulatory requirements “the person is taken to have received the document at the end of the day on which the document is transmitted” (Tay v Minister for Immigration & Citizenship [2010] FCAFC 23, Xie v Minister for Immigration & Multicultural & Indigenous Affairs  [2005] FCAFC 172 and Kim v Minister for Immigration & Multicultural Affairs  [2006] FCAFC 64). To the extent therefore that the applicants’ arguments rely on actual, rather than deemed receipt, that aspect of the applicants’ ground must be rejected. Second, before the Court the applicants failed to understand at least one important part of Mr Bockxmeer’s evidence. The applicants’ argument was that the representative’s office was closed on the day of transmission and the email must have “bounced back” to the delegate because of that reason. I can take judicial note of the fact that emails are not sent to an office, or even a computer terminal in an office. Rather, emails are “sent” to a “mail server” of the relevant internet service provider. Email communications can then be downloaded and accessed by a computer terminal in an office. The transmission of the document is successful if it is transmitted to that mail server. Mr Bockxmeer’s evidence is that such a successful transmission of the delegate’s letter of notification of the decision occurred on 2 January 2014, when the email was successfully transmitted to “the host... Internet Protocol (IP) address...” (at [8](c) of Mr Bockxmeer’s affidavit). In these circumstances, whether the agent’s office was closed, or not, on 2 January 2014 is of no consequence. The applicants are taken to have received the notification. Importantly, the applicants have not provided any evidence to indicate that there was any difficulty at the agent’s host internet provider’s point of receipt of transmissions, such that an inference may be drawn that the email “bounced back” to the delegate. In the circumstances, Mr Bockxmeer’s evidence in this regard remains unchallenged. In the circumstances, I accept Mr Bockxmeer’s evidence. An analogy may be drawn here with another method available to the Minister for the giving of documents to a person as set out in s.424B of the Act. The Minister may elect to send the document by post to a residential or business address provided for that purpose. If the Minister had elected to send the notification by post to the agent’s business address, which, in this case, was a post office box address (see CB 10.5), then a successful despatch of the document to that post office box address would be sufficient to say that the applicant would be taken to have received the document in that circumstance (see ss.494B(4)(c)(ii) and 494C(4) of the Act). If the agent were to leave the letter in the post office box and not collect (“receive”) the document until some time later, the applicants would still be taken to have received the document 7 days after the date of the despatch of the letter, irrespective of the date when the letter is collected. This is analogous to the current circumstances. The notification was “successfully transmitted” to the electronic equivalent of a post office box. Given the provisions of s.494C(5) of the Act, the applicants were taken to have received the document, electronically, at the end of the day it was transmitted. This is irrespective of when that electronic communication (email) is downloaded. The applicant referred the Court to Kaur v Minister for Immigration and Border Protection [2014] FCA 915 (“Kaur”). The applicants’ legal representative’s oral submissions before the Court need to be considered in light of the applicants’ written submissions to ascertain meaning.  At best, I understood the applicants’ attempt to rely on Kaur to be as follows. In Kaur, the Court found that the Tribunal acted unreasonably. In Kaur, the Tribunal sent a letter to the applicant in that case inviting her to a hearing. The letter was not received by the applicant, yet the Tribunal proceeded to make a decision when the applicant did not appear at the hearing. The Court found that the Tribunal acted unreasonably and therefore fell into jurisdictional error. From this the applicants asserted that in the current case the Minister’s delegate acted unreasonably. It was not made clear by the applicants what specific conduct was said to be unreasonable. At best the “unreasonableness” appears to arise from the delegate’s alleged failure to “follow up” with the applicants’ representative to ascertain if the notification letter had been received.  The Tribunal’s legal error was said to be that the Tribunal should not have “relied” on the “deemed receipt” of the notification letter on 2 January 2014. What was said by the applicants to be “unreasonable” was the Tribunal’s failure to accept the submissions made to it that the migration agent had not “received” the email. Further, that it failed to consider that as it was “Christmas time” the office “might be closed” thereby requiring “extra care” by the delegate and that the “documents” (the letter of notification and the decision record) had “never reached the applicants’ mail box on the balance of probabilities” (see the applicants’ written submissions at [23]). The extent of the applicants’ submissions in relation to Kaur were that that case also dealt with the non-receipt of a letter by an applicant, no inquiry was made to see if the applicant had received the letter, and the Court found that this was unreasonable. This conclusion, therefore, should also be reached in the current case. The Court attempted to focus the applicants’ attention to the entirety of the circumstances and reasoning in Kaur. In particular, to extract from the applicants some meaningful submission on how Kaur, when respectfully read in its totality, could assist the applicants in light of the specific circumstances in the current case. This resulted in references by the applicants’ representative before the Court to the Court’s rejection in Kaur of the Minister’s submissions in relation to the matter of “a legal factor”. Although in oral submissions the applicants did not take the Court to any specific part of Kaur, the written submissions do reproduce Kaur at [120] – [123] (see the applicant’s written submissions at [18]). I, therefore, understood the oral submissions to seek to rely on what Justice Mortimer said in Kaur at [122] (“...the term legal fact...”). The answer to the applicants’ ground, and their reliance on Kaur, is that Kaur was concerned with the Tribunal’s exercise of a statutory discretion (s.362B of the Act, at the relevant time) to proceed to the making of a decision on review. The applicant had been invited to a hearing pursuant to s.360 of the Act. She did not appear at the hearing. The Tribunal proceeded to make a decision. The Court found, in the circumstances of that case, that the Tribunal’s exercise of the power found in s.362B of the Act was unreasonable. I respectfully understood that it was in that context that the Court found that the Minister’s submissions as to the term “legal fact” (Kaur at [122]) were unhelpful. That is because the “deemed receipt” provisions operate to allow the discretion in s.362B of the Act to arise for consideration by the Tribunal after a defined period of time (Kaur at [122]). In my respectful view, the Court made clear that the “deemed receipt” provisions “do not... govern or determine the outcome of the consideration by the Tribunal of how to exercise that discretion” (Kaur at [123]).  In the current case, the delegate was not exercising any discretion in sending the letter of notification of the decision. The delegate had no discretion. Section 66(1) of the Act makes clear that in circumstances where the Minister, or his delegate, refuses to grant a visa he is to notify the applicants in the prescribed way. That “prescription” as relevant to this case is set out above (at [25]). As set out above, the delegate followed the relevant statutory and regulatory requirements. In any event, I cannot see that the key elements arising from the circumstances in Kaur, and on which the finding of legal unreasonableness was made, are present in the current case. For example, one of the elements was the delay occasioned by the Tribunal’s unexplained inaction in the conduct of the review. The delay was a period of nearly two years between the application for review and the first substantial communication from the Tribunal to the applicant (see Kaur at [87]). Another element was the use of different methods of communication by the Tribunal to the applicant during the process of the review (see Kaur at [90]). In the current case, the delegate wrote to the applicants on 5 April 2013 inviting comment on information that the applicant had not been sponsored as she claimed (CB 46). That letter was sent by email to the agent’s (same) email address. The applicants made no response to this invitation. There is no evidence before the Court, nor was there any before the Tribunal, that the agent did not receive this letter at the same email address to which the notification of the decision was subsequently sent. Nor was any such claim made before the Court now. Further, there is nothing before the Court to indicate that the delegate would have had any reason to believe that the email had “bounced back”. By contrast, in Kaur, the letter of invitation to the hearing was returned to the Tribunal marked “RTS” (presumably “Return to Sender”) (see Kaur at [93]). I also note, as set out above, that the date of transmission of the email by the delegate to the agent’s email address was 2 January 2014. This was a weekday (Thursday). It was not a public holiday in NSW (the agents were located in NSW – CB 45). The Tribunal’s decision was that in circumstances where the delegate’s notification complied with all of the relevant statutory and regulatory requirements, it did not have jurisdiction, with reference to s.347(1) of the Act, to review the delegate’s decision because the relevant application was not made within the prescribed time. There is no dispute from the applicants now that an application received outside the prescribed time is not a valid application and an application in respect of which the Tribunal does not have jurisdiction (see Cheng v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship  [2011] FCA 1290;  (2011) 198 FCR 559 (“Cheng”)). The Tribunal’s finding that it lacked jurisdiction in the current circumstances, because of s.347(1) of the Act, cannot, as the Minister correctly submitted, be “legally unreasonable”, given that s.347 of the Act does not confer a discretion, or even a power, on the Tribunal. For the applicants’ benefit, it must be stressed this is of obvious distinction with the situation in Kaur. There was nothing before the Tribunal to support the applicants’ representative’s speculation that the delegate’s email “bounced back” or that the delegate should have “followed up” with the applicants’ representative. In all, ground one is not made out. Ground two asserts the Tribunal made “judicial error” (I understood this to mean legal error as the Tribunal is not a Court), because it failed to find that the application for review was made within the “statutory time limits”. To the extent that the particulars to ground two ((a) and (b), and to a large extent (c) and (e)), repeat the complaint made in ground one, they are of no assistance to the applicants for the reasons given above. The remainder of (c) and (e) can only be understood as submissions by the applicants and not assertions of legal error. Particular (f) to ground two directs attention to “s.497C(7)” of the Act. This was repeated in written submissions. No such subsection existed in the Act at the relevant time. Ultimately, the applicants legal representative before the Court was directed to s.494C(7) and he agreed that was the subsection relevant to ground two:   “(7)  If:  (a)  the Minister purports to give a document to a person in accordance with a method specified in section 494B (including in a case covered by section 494A) but makes an error in doing so; and  (b)  the person nonetheless receives the document or a copy of it;  then the person is taken to have received the document at the times mentioned in this section as if the Minister had given the document to the person without making an error in doing so, unless the person can show that he or she received it at a later time, in which case, the person is taken to have received it at that time.” Although not entirely clear, the argument before the Court appeared to be that s.494C(7) of the Act refers to an “error” in the giving of a document by the Minister to a person, and in this case, the delegate made an error. The applicants have misconceived the operation of s.494C(7) of the Act. Plainly, that section seeks to cure the situation where an “error” has occurred in the giving of a document by the Minister, but the person in any event receives the letter. In essence, the subsection operates, in favour of the Minister, to preserve the situation of a successful giving of the document by the Minister to a person, even though there has been some “error” in the giving (see Cheng and Rana v Minister for Immigration and Border Protection  [2014] FCA 1233). In any event, for the reasons already set out above, there was no error in the delegate’s giving of the notification letter to the applicants. In that circumstance, I agree with the Minister that s.494C(7) of the Act is of no assistance to the applicants. Ground two is not made out. Conclusion  No legal error is revealed in the Tribunal’s decision. The application should be dismissed. I will make an order accordingly.I certify that the preceding sixty-four (64) paragraphs are a true copy of the reasons for judgment of Judge NichollsAssociate:  Date: 6 November 2015       \",\n",
       " 'Dhillon & Anor v Minister for Immigration & Anor [2015] FCCA 3306 (21 December 2015)': '  The second applicant is the husband of the first applicant and proceeds by way of being a family member.   The applicants seek judicial review of a determination of the Migration Review Tribunal (“the Tribunal”) made 12 November 2014 affirming a decision of the Minister’s delegate to refuse the grant of a Student (Temporary) (Class TU) visa (“the visa”).   Background  The applicants are from India.   The first applicant first came to Australia on 19 July 2012 as the holder of a Subclass 485 Temporary Graduate visa.  That visa expired on 11 July 2013.  She then lodged an application for a student visa on 16 January 2014.  That application was refused by the Minister’s delegate on 20 January 2014.   The applicants made an application to this Court for judicial review on 11 December 2014.  The applicants appear in person.  They did not require an interpreter.  They had not provided written submissions in accordance with the Registrar’s directions.   I have had the benefit of the first respondent’s written submissions. The applicants’ application raises two grounds of complaint, being:  (1) The Second Respondent’s decision was affected by jurisdictional error in that the applicant was denied procedural fairness under s 359A of the Migration Act 1958.  Particulars  (a) The Applicant applied for a review on or about 6 February 2014.  As there was no consistency in processing time of the review applications, there was no way that the applicant knew of the likely timeframe to have a hearing allocated by the Second Respondent.    (b) The Applicant appeared for the hearing without evidence of her Cl.572.211 substantive Visa because she was not aware it was a reason the Tribunal was considering to refuse her application.    (c) The Applicant given notice was able to show that she had a valid Temporary Graduate subclass 485 visa.    (2) The Second Respondent made jurisdictional error in that it denied the applicant procedural fairness or failed to take into account relevant considerations in refusing the application request for an adjournment or additional time to obtain more documentation.  The Applicant relies on the principle in Minister for Immigration and Citizenship v Li  [2013] HCA 18 (8 May 2013).    Particulars  (a) The applicant relies on the particulars in grounds 1. The second applicant made oral submissions on behalf of both applicants. Tribunal’s Decision   An application for a visa of the type sought by the first applicant must meet the requirements specified in the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) (“the Act”) and the Migration Regulations 1994 (“the Regulations”).  If the application is made in Australia then the applicant is to meet the requirements in clause 572.211 of schedule 2 of the Regulations.  That subclause at (2)(a) lists a number of visa types or classes.  There was no evidence before the Tribunal that the first applicant held any such visa type or class. Subparagraph (3) provides:    (3) An applicant meets the requirements of this subclause if:  (a) the applicant is not the holder of a substantive visa;  and  (b) the last substantive visa held by the applicant was:  (i) a student visa;  or  (ii) a special purpose visa;  or  (iii) a Subclass 303 (Emergency (Temporary Visa Applicant)) visa;  or  (iv) a Diplomatic (Temporary) (Class TF) visa granted to the holder as the spouse, de facto partner or a dependent relative, of a diplomatic or consular representative of a foreign country;  or  (v) a subclass 497 (Graduate – Skilled) visa;  and  (c) the application is made within 28 days (or within such period specified by Gazette Notice) after:  (i) the day when the last substantive visa ceased to be in effect;  (ii) if the last substantive visa was cancelled, and the Migration Review Tribunal has made a decision to set aside and substitute the cancellation decision of the Minister’s decision not to revoke the cancellation ... The Tribunal found that the first applicant’s last substantive visa had expired on 11 July 2013 and that her visa application had not been lodged until 16 January 2014, thereby being well outside the 28 day time limit as required by cl.472.211(3), and that she did not therefore meet the requirements of cl.572.211 of schedule 2.[1]  The Application to this Court  It eventuated that the only oral submission of any force put to this Court was an assertion that the first applicant had held a bridging visa at the time of her application for a visa lodged 16 January 2014.  The applicants had evidence of such a visa at Court and that evidence was accepted as an exhibit in these proceedings on the basis that this was not a fact disputed by the first respondent. It is clear that the applicants were under the misapprehension that the holding of a bridging visa satisfied the requirements of cl.572.211.  Given that they are clearly mistaken in this assumption there is no merit to this ground of their application. No oral submissions were made before me in respect of ground 2 of the application.  There is no evidence in the Tribunal’s reasons of any adjournment application being sought either prior to or at the Tribunal hearing.  The applicants do not particularise any “relevant” considerations which the Tribunal failed to take into account in respect of any adjournment sought.  The applicants, in fact, did not assert in their submissions to this Court that they made any application for an adjournment.  As such, I find no merit in ground 2 of the application.   In conclusion, there being no merit to either ground in the application, the application will be dismissed with costs.I certify that the preceding sixteen (16) paragraphs are a true copy of the reasons for judgment of Judge McGuireDate: 21 December 2015 [1] Migration Review Tribunal, 13 November 2014, at 28       ',\n",

       " 'Kumar v Minister for Immigration & Anor [2015] FCCA 2709 (4 September 2015)': \" (revised from the transcript)  This is an application for review of a decision of the Migration Review Tribunal.  The matter comes before the court as a show cause hearing under r.44.12 of the Federal Circuit Court Rules 2001 (“the rules”).  If the court is not satisfied that the applicant has raised an arguable case for relief the court can dismiss the application.  The first respondent asks the court to dismiss the application in this case on the grounds that there is no arguable case for relief.   The applicant applied for a partner visa on 29 June 2012.  One of the requirements for that visa was that the application be made within 28 days after the relevant day.  The relevant day was defined in criterion 3001 of sch.3 to the Migration Regulations 1994 (Cth) (“the regulations”) to be the last day when the applicant held a substantive visa.  In this case the applicant last held a dependent student visa on 10 October 2011.  As the applicant applied for the partner visa on 29 June 2012, the application was made more than 28 days after the relevant day. The regulations permitted the requirement in criterion 3001 to be waived if there were compelling reasons.  That appears in cl.820.21(d)(ii) of sch.2 to the regulations.  That was a time of application criterion.  The tribunal noted various authorities dealing with the notion of compelling reasons.   The applicant submitted that he had an Australian born child from his marriage with the sponsor.  The tribunal accepted that there was such a child who was born on9 April 2013.  The tribunal accepted that the applicant was the father of that child.  The tribunal further accepted that if the child had been conceived at the time of application the conception of the child would be a compelling reason that may justify the waiving of the schedule 3 requirements.  The tribunal said in its reasons at paragraph 19 that it discussed with the applicant at the hearing that if the date of the conception of the child was approximately the date of application the tribunal would consider that this may amount to a compelling reason in this particular case. The tribunal also discussed with the applicant's representative in the hearing that if the date of conception was outside the 38 week period of gestation then the tribunal was unlikely to be satisfied that the birth of the child arose out of circumstances that existed at the time of application.   The tribunal recorded in paragraph 20 in its reasons for decision that it discussed with the applicant and his representative that 38 weeks prior to 9 April 2013 would be the approximate date of conception. The tribunal noted in its reasons that, after the hearing, the tribunal calculated that 40 weeks prior to 9 April 2013 is 3 July 2012.  The tribunal said that it was satisfied that, allowing up to 40 weeks for the pregnancy, the child of the applicant was not conceived at the time of application.  The tribunal concluded that the birth of the applicant’s child on 9 April 2013 could not be considered to have arisen out of circumstances that existed at the time of application.  The tribunal concluded that it did not consider the fact that the applicant had an Australian born child was a compelling reason for waiving the sch.3 criteria. The applicant argued before the tribunal that he provided support to the sponsor at the time of application.  The applicant reported that he had met the sponsor on an internet site.  He claimed that, while living in Victoria, he flew to Queensland to be with her on occasion.  He initially said that he went up to Queensland each month, but later said he went every two or three months.  The applicant also indicated that he moved in with the sponsor in March 2012, which was about three months prior to the date of application. The tribunal put to the applicant a protection order made in the Ipswich Magistrates Court on 17 June 2013.  That order prohibited the applicant from committing domestic violence against the sponsor and four children, three of whom the sponsor had before she met the applicant, and the other child being the child of the applicant and the sponsor.  The order restrained the applicant from being in the vicinity of the sponsor or the children for a period of two years.  The tribunal brought the protection order to the applicant's attention pursuant to s.359AA of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) (“the Act”). The tribunal said that it explained to the applicant that the significance of the order was that the applicant may not have been supportive of the sponsor at the time of application.  As stated, the order was made on 17 June 2013 and the application was made on 29 June 2012.  The applicant consulted with his representative and chose to make submissions later in the tribunal hearing.  The representative said that the relationship had broken down after the visa application was lodged.  He said the intervention order was made almost a year after the visa application was lodged. The applicant said he consented to the intervention order without admissions.  He said that, after the order was made, and he had separated from the sponsor, he continued to visit the child at the home of the sponsor.  The tribunal accepted that the relationship between the applicant and the sponsor might have been quite good at the time of application.  The tribunal also accepted that there was no evidence before it that the protection order related to any incident that occurred at the time of application.  However, the tribunal was not satisfied that the support offered by the applicant at the time of application was of such a nature that it could be considered compelling.   The tribunal considered a psychological report provided by the applicant.  However, the tribunal did not consider that the psychological report provided compelling reasons for waiving the sch.3 criteria.  The tribunal said that it considered all the matters put to it individually and collectively, and was not satisfied that there were compelling reasons justifying a waiver of the sch.3 criteria.  The tribunal considered various other provisions in the partner visa category. However, it was not satisfied that the applicant met any of them.  Consequently, the tribunal was not satisfied that the applicant met the criteria for the visa. The applicant was not represented before this court.  His application said that he was not satisfied with the decision made by the tribunal.  He said that he believed there was an error in the decision. However, he did not say what the error was.  Before the court today the applicant said that the tribunal asked him why he did not go back to India to lodge his application.  He said that he told the tribunal that he could not go back because his ex-wife had three children.  He said that his family was no longer in contact with him because he had married outside his culture.  None of this goes to the question of whether the tribunal made a jurisdictional error.   There are concerns about whether the tribunal dealt properly with the issue of the date of conception of the applicant’s and sponsor’s child.  As I understand it, human pregnancies normally last 40 weeks calculated from the date of the last period.  Often that works out to be 38 weeks from the actual date of conception. However, as is well known, pregnancies can last more than the normal time.  Indeed, some pregnancies can last 43 weeks.  The tribunal’s approach to this matter assumed that 40 weeks was the maximum. According to its reasons the tribunal said some things during the hearing that may have misled the applicant.  The tribunal said in its reasons that it discussed with the applicant and his representative in the hearing that if the date of conception of the child was approximately the date of application the tribunal would consider this may amount to a compelling reason in this particular case.  The material before the court does not include the delegate's decision.  It only includes the tribunal's decision.   No court book was provided in accordance with the usual practice in relation to show cause matters.  The tribunal’s reasons do not specify precisely what the delegate’s reasons were for rejecting the application.  The tribunal's reasons merely say that the delegate found the applicant failed to satisfy the requirements of sub-cl.820.211.  It is possible that, if the tribunal had not said that it would regard the circumstance that the date of conception was approximately the date of application as a compelling reason, then the applicant might have sought leave to adduce further evidence. It is obviously very difficult to establish with certainty the date of a child's conception. However, there may have been an ultrasound conducted early in the pregnancy which would have led to an estimated due date.  It is possible that such an item of evidence could have been made available if the tribunal had not said that it would accept that if the date of conception of the child was approximately the date of application it would consider that to be a compelling reason.   I note that the tribunal also said that it discussed with the applicant’s representative that if the date of conception was outside the 38 week period of gestation, the tribunal was unlikely to be satisfied that the birth of the child arose out of circumstances that existed at the time of application.  However, the earlier statement can perhaps be seen as prevailing over the latter.   I note the submissions of the respondent’s solicitor that it was for the applicant to provide such evidence as he wished. However, in view of the tribunal’s potentially misleading statement during the hearing, I am concerned that the applicant may not have been given natural justice.   Evidence of the delegate’s decision may shed light on this matter. As the matter stands, I do not consider that this case reaches the level where I cannot be satisfied that an arguable case for relief has been raised.   I also note that there are time of decision criteria which the applicant may well have satisfied.  Under cl.820.221 of sch.2 of the regulations, the applicant was required to either continue to meet the time of application criteria or meet the requirements of sub-cls.2 or 3. Subclause 3 required that the applicant would have continued to meet the time of application criteria except that the relationship between him and the sponsor had ceased and one or the other of paras. (i) or (ii) applied.  The second of those included that the applicant had formal maintenance obligations in respect of the child.  The applicant said, and the tribunal appears to have accepted, that he had been paying child support.  There is a record in the material provided by the applicant that shows a child support account that supports the view that the applicant would meet the time of decision criteria. Consequently, if there were some error by the tribunal in relation to the handling of the period of gestation, there may be some utility in remitting the matter to the tribunal. In the circumstances, I am not satisfied that the applicant has failed to raise an arguable case for relief.  I consider that the matter should be listed for a final hearing, and a court book with full material should be provided to the court.I certify that the preceding twenty-two (22) paragraphs are a true copy of the reasons for judgment of Judge RileyAssociate:  Date:  5 October 2015       \",\n",
       " 'Kumar v Minister for Immigration & Anor [2015] FCCA 3161 (26 November 2015)': \"  This is an application within the Court’s jurisdiction under s.476 of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) in respect of a decision of the Tribunal made on 28 May 2015 affirming the decision of the delegate not to grant the applicant a Partner (Temporary) Class UK visa.   The applicant applied for the visa on 21 March 2012.  The delegate refused to grant the visa on 3 February 2015 on the basis the applicant did not satisfy cl.820.21 at the time of application because the delegate was not satisfied that the applicant was the spouse of the sponsor as well as holding that the criteria under cl.820.22 at the time of decision were not met.   Relevantly, the Tribunal identified the requirements of s.5F of the Migration Act 1958 and also reg.1.15A in its reasons. The Tribunal summarised the criteria that the applicant must meet to be a “spouse” within the meaning of the regulations. The applicant and the sponsor commenced the relationship on 15 February 2012 and got married on 16 March 2012.  On 11 February 2013 the sponsor indicated the relationship was over and withdrew her sponsorship of the applicant’s application.  The applicant on 18 April 2013 advised the Department that the relationship had broken down due to the sponsor’s gambling addiction and alleged the applicant had been the victim of family violence.  Relevantly, the delegate found (CB101):    ...I am unable to establish that the relationship between you and the sponsoring partner had the elements of a genuine and continuing relationship as specified in Regulation 1.15A at the time you made this application.   On 15 January 2015 the Tribunal sent a letter inviting the applicant to appear to give evidence and present arguments at a hearing to be held on 25 March 2015.  The applicant appeared on that date to give evidence and present arguments and the Tribunal also received evidence from a witness.  Prior to that hearing, a legal representative on behalf of the applicant sent submissions to the Tribunal dated 17 March 2015 that squarely recognised and put submissions on the issue of whether there was a genuine continuing relationship.   After the hearing on 31 March 2015 the Tribunal invited the applicant to respond to information that the Tribunal identified was information, if relied upon, would be the reason or part of the reason for finding that the applicant was not in a genuine and continuing relationship at the time of the application as required by s.5F of the Migration Act 1958.  The applicant was given an opportunity to respond to that material on or before 14 April 2015.  Further material in response was provided by the applicant to the Tribunal which was referred to in para.35 of the Tribunal’s decision.   Leave was granted to file an amended application raising the following grounds:  1. The Second Respondent made jurisdictional error by deciding that the Applicant and his Sponsor were not in a married relationship as defined by section SF (2) of the Migration Act 1958 without having regard to all of the matters made mandatory by Reg.1.1 SA(2).  Particulars  a) The Second Respondent did not consider the matters in :  Reg.1.15A (3)(a): (iii), (iv) and (v)  Reg.1.15A (3)(b ):(ii), (iii)  Reg.1.15 (3) (c)  Reg. 1.15A (3)(d)  2. The Second Respondent made jurisdictional error by making a decision based only upon the motivation of the Sponsor for financial gain.  2A. In making a decision that the Sponsor entered into the marriage for financial gain, the Second Respondent made a finding on a critical matter in respect of which there was no evidence or other material to justify the making of the finding.  2B. The Second Respondent made jurisdictional error by assuming that a marriage entered by one of the parties for financial gain is, by reason of that fact alone, not a genuine and continuing spousal relationship.  2C. The Second Respondent made jurisdictional error by failing to consider the Applicant's family violence claim in circumstances where it was mandatory for the Second Respondent to have regard to the duration of the relationship.  3. The Second Respondent denied the Applicant procedural fairness by failing to inform him of any suggestion that the Applicant had not entered or intended to enter a genuine relationship.  4. The Second Respondent based its decision on irrelevant or irrational considerations related exclusively to the motivation of the Sponsor or her desire to use the Applicant for her benefit. Counsel for the applicant focused upon the finding of the Tribunal in para.28 which is as follows:    28. The Tribunal has considered Mr Kumar’s claimed family violence. The Tribunal on the evidence is satisfied that the parties shared a sexual relationship. The Tribunal is not satisfied that the parties shared a spousal relationship. The Tribunal on the evidence from the visa applicant and the witnesses is satisfied that the sponsor entered into the marriage for financial gain and that the parties’ relationship was not a genuine and continuing spousal relationship. Counsel also referred to the finding of the Tribunal in para.18 as follows:    18.    The Tribunal must consider all the circumstances of the relationship (including the matters specified in r.1.15A) in determining whether the parties are in a “married relationship” as defined by s.5F(2). The Tribunal has had regard to the parties’ financial relationship; the nature of their household; the social aspects of the relationship; and the nature of their commitment to each other. On these aspects the Tribunal has considered all the evidence before it and is satisfied the facts of this case are as follows: The decision of the Tribunal dated 28 May 2015 had attachment “A” pages 11 and 12 of 12 pages . Every page was marked as being one page number out of 12. The attachment “A” comprised reg.1.15A.  I am satisfied that on a fair reading of the Tribunal’s decision that attachment “A” formed part of the decision of the Tribunal.   Contrary to the applicant’s submissions, I find the Tribunal clearly had regard to the requirements which were made mandatory by reg.1.15A.  The Tribunal acknowledged those mandatory requirements in para.18.  It is not necessary for the Tribunal to individually address each of the subcategories in its reasoning, provided it has had regard to each of those subcategories.  On a fair reading of the Tribunal’s decision there is no basis to infer that the Tribunal did not have an intellectual engagement with and have regard to each of the mandatory matters identified in reg.1.15A.  Ground 1 fails to make out any jurisdictional error.   In relation to ground 2, the substance of the applicant’s argument was that the finding of there being no genuine and continuing spousal relationship was, in substance, because of the finding that the sponsor had entered into the marriage for financial gain.  The Tribunal’s reasons do not express that limitation in relation to the finding made by the Tribunal.  On a fair reading, it cannot be said that the Tribunal’s decision of there being no genuine and continuing spousal relationship was based only upon the motivation of the sponsor for financial gain.  Nor, on a fair reading can it be said that the motivation of the sponsor was substantially the basis for the Tribunal’s conclusion.  It is clear that the Tribunal took into account a combination of matters as identified in paras.8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 19, 22, 23, 24 and 27, as well as the findings made in the third sentence of para.28.  Ground 2 fails to make out any jurisdictional error.   In relation to ground 2A, it is clear from the matters identified in paras.22, 23 and 24 that it cannot be said there was no evidentiary basis for the adverse finding in relation to the motivation of the sponsor entering into the marriage for financial gain.  No jurisdictional error is made out by ground 2A.   In relation to ground 2B, counsel for the applicant contended that the finding as to the relationship not being a genuine and continuing spousal relationship, in essence, was because of one party having the intention to obtain financial gain. I accept counsel for the applicant’s submission that if, in fact, the finding had been so confined that may give rise to a jurisdictional error.  However, it is clear from the language in the reference to “the parties” and a fair reading of the Tribunal’s reasons that the finding of no genuine and continuing relationship was not so confined.  Ground 2B fails to make out any jurisdictional error.   In relation to ground 2C, counsel for the applicant contends that the circumstances of the relationship within reg.1.15A(2) as well as the requirements of subreg.(3)(d)(i) required the family violence to be the subject of findings in the context of the duration of the relationship in the present case.  The Tribunal relevantly said:    29.    The Tribunal on the evidence is not satisfied that a spousal relationship existed between Mr Kumar and Ms Naidu. Accordingly Mr Kumar cannot satisfy cl.820.211(2). Therefore, the Tribunal has not considered Mr Kumar’s claimed family violence further. It is clear from the Tribunal’s reasons at paras.11, 12, 25 and 27 that the issue of violence in the relationship had been taken into account so far as the requirements of reg.1.15A(2) and subcl.(3)(d)(i) are concerned. Given that the Tribunal decision must be read as a whole, the duration of the relationship was squarely identified in paras.8 and 9.  Where the Tribunal has found there is no genuine relationship, it is not necessary for the Tribunal to go on to determine the issue of family violence.  The Tribunal was correct not to do so.  There was no error of the kind identified in ground 2C.   In relation to ground 3, it is clear from the decision of the Tribunal that the question of a genuine relationship at the time of the application was a live issue on the face of the determination of the delegate.  That live issue was clearly apparent from the fact that the legal representative of the applicant addressed that matter in the submission letter prior to the hearing on 17 March 2015.  I also accept the first respondent’s submissions that the letter dated 31 March 2015, made clear the question of whether there was a genuine and continuing relationship at the time of the application was a live issue.  Ground 3 fails to make out any jurisdictional error.   In relation to ground 4, I accept the first respondent’s submission that the motivation of one spouse is relevant in light of reg.1.15A(2) given the reference to all of the circumstances as well as being relevant under reg.(3)(d).  This is not a case in which it can be said that the adverse finding of the Tribunal was based exclusively or substantially on the motivation of one sponsor.  Ground 4 fails to make out any jurisdictional error.  The amended application is dismissed.  I certify that the preceding seventeen (17) paragraphs are a true copy of the reasons for judgment of Judge StreetAssociate:  Date:  30 November 2015       \",\n",
       " 'MZAAE v Minister for Immigration & Anor [2015] FCCA 1470 (27 July 2015)': '  The substantive application is for judicial review of a decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal (“the Tribunal”) affirming a decision of the Minister’s Delegate refusing the grant of a Protection (Class XA) visa (“the visa”) to the primary applicant. The remaining applicants are members of the primary applicant’s family. The Tribunal’s decision was made on 9 July 2013. This application was not lodged until 20 February 2014, being some six months outside the 30 day prescribed time limit. The preliminary application is therefore one for a grant of an extension of time to lodge the substantive application. The applicant pleads the following grounds for an extension of time:i) That his agent had advised him to apply for ministerial intervention; ii) That he was unaware of his right to apply for a judicial review until 19 February 2014 and that he then acted prudently in filing his application on the following day.  The applicant’s amended application filed 30 March 2015 raises four grounds of complaint being:i. The Second Respondent committed a jurisdictional error in that it acted pursuant to a process compromised by “third party fraud”. ii. The Second Respondent erred by failing to consider any integer of the Applicant’s claim, namely that he would be targeted because of his actual or imputed political opinion. iii. The Second Respondent erred in its exercise of discretion in s. 426A of the Migration Act 1958. iv. The Second Respondent erred by unreasonably refusing an adjournment request.  The role of the application’s agent, Ijaz Ahmad, was significant to the applicant’s application both for an extension of time and for substantive relief. Mr Ahmad gave oral evidence for the applicant. He did so voluntarily and apparently without the coercion of a subpoena. He was cross-examined by Counsel for the first respondent. The primary applicant also gave oral evidence and was cross-examined. There are important issues of credit and disputed fact between the applicant and Mr Ahmad. Firstly, the applicant claims that he instructed Mr Ahmad to make an application to the Tribunal for an adjournment. He says that either his instructions were not carried out or that the agent wilfully did not advise him that an adjournment was not available. Importantly, he says that the agent was motivated by self-interest in not wanting to be exposed as operating as an agent contrary to provisions and requirements of the Migration Agent Registration Authority (“MARA”). He says that he was therefore denied the opportunity to appear before the Tribunal which proceeded to its determination in his absence. He argues that this operated as a fraud on the Tribunal stultifying its process. Both Mr Ahmad and the applicant gave evidence and were cross-examined in respect of Mr Ahmad’s advice to the applicant post the Tribunal determination. Secondly, the applicant says that he was advised to pursue Ministerial intervention and not advised unambiguously of the option of an application to this Court. Mr Ahmad says both options were offered and explained. Crucial to this argument is an email from Mr Ahmad to the applicant of 15 July 2013 annexed to the applicant’s affidavit filed 24 March 2015 which says the following:Please find your Refusal Letter from RRT. You have two options either go to Minister and than (sic) apply to the court if needed There is balance owing of: $4050/- please fix this asap as I don,t like to proceed further with leagal (sic) action against you thanks. I can lodge your application for Minister advise me on this. Kind Regards, Mr. IJAZ AHMAD (Principal) Australian Qualified & Accredited Migration Agent Registration Number: 0849992  The applicant also relies on his own affidavit affirmed 23 March 2015 together with two prior affidavits of 7 November 2014 and 20 February 2014 and in respect of his professional relationship with Mr Ahmad. He also relies on an affidavit of Emily Kate Bentleigh Singh, Lawyer, sworn 23 March 2015. That affidavit reports of investigations into the business names and/or company umbrellas under which Mr Ahmad operates as a migration agent. Background.  The applicants are from India being Hindus from the Punjab area. The primary applicant says that he was active in political life and through an uncle who was prominent in the Congress Party. The applicant says that in 1995 political opponents came to his house and verbally and physically attacked him and his wife. He says that he was the victim of a political scam and that his reputation was sullied. He was then threatened, blackmailed, kidnapped, abused and tortured. He says that he moved from the Punjab area but that his son was kidnapped during a visit in 2010 but was recovered after the payment of a ransom. The applicants say that they have a well-founded fear of being killed, harmed physically, sexually and mentally and of being kidnapped. The applicants applied for protection visas on 19 June 2012. The Delegate refused the grant of visas on 7 August 2012. The Tribunal properly considered its statutory parameters [4-7] with reference to the alternative criteria in s.36(2)(a), (aa), (b) and (c) of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) (“the Act”) and its Regulations 1994.  The Tribunal did not have the primary applicant appear before it at the hearing. The applicant had, however, provided “limited documentary material” with the Tribunal noting at [24] of its reasons:Limited documentary material has been provided to the Tribunal. The Tribunal has not been able to test this material with the applicants. Applicant 1’s claims are largely bare assertions as to past events and as to the harm feared. He did not attend in interview with the delegate.  At [26] the Tribunal notes:The applicants were put on notice that the Tribunal was unable to make a favourable decision on the evidence provided by applicant 1 in support of his application. He did not provide further evidence, despite ample opportunity to do so. He has not given the Tribunal the opportunity to explore his claims at a hearing.  The Tribunal was not satisfied as to the criterion under s.36(2)(a) and proceeded to consider the complementary protection criterion under s.36(2)(aa) and found that the applicant does not have substantial grounds for believing that, as a necessary and foreseeable consequence being removed from Australia to India, there is a real risk that he will suffer significant harm [28]. The applicant claims that he did wish to and intended to appear before the Tribunal. A previous hearing date was adjourned by the Tribunal and he says that he was prepared and intending to appear on that day. Extension of time.  S.477(2) of the Act gives the Court power to extend time if the Court is satisfied that it is in the interest of administration of justice to do so. The usual considerations are firstly, the explanation for the delay; secondly, the length of the delay- with perhaps a greater burden put on the explanation commensurate with the longer the delay;[1] thirdly, the balances of prejudice which accompany an application seeking an indulgence of the court; and finally, the merits of the substantive application.  In the matter now before me, the applicant relies on the Court accepting him as credible against Mr Ahmad both in his explanation of his delay and also in respect of the ground of his application being that the agent perpetrated a fraud which compromised the Tribunal’s process. The applicant says that he was not advised of the options of either reference to the Minister or for judicial review. Mr Ahmad in cross examination said:Counsel: Did you ever advise the applicant that he had the right to come to Court to challenge the Tribunal’s decision? Ahmad: Yes, sir. I always- I even – even right at the start with my first appointment with him I told him about this procedure; that he will go to the Department of Immigration, then we have RRT if he got refused, then we got Court or we go to Minister. Okay. So with the Court I cannot deal with; Minister I can. He has been clearly advised on this and he has also been clearly advised on the success of his case on the current information he has provided me and that is written and signed by MZAAE on the contract.[2]  The email of 15 July 2013 is of little use in resolving this issue of credit. Its terms are ambiguous and capable of support in its interpretation for both the applicant and Mr Ahmad. Its language and consequential ambiguity perhaps says something about the less than adequate command of the English language of both of these witnesses. Mr Ahmad was in many ways an impressive witness. He was confident and assertive in his evidence. He says that he did receive instructions from the applicant to seek an adjournment. He says that he telephoned the Tribunal as to the prospects of an adjournment and received a negative response. I take his evidence, therefore, to be that there was no formal application put on behalf of the applicant for consideration by the Tribunal. Rather, he made a more general “testing of the waters”. I accept his evidence in this context. He says that he advised the applicant accordingly. The issue here is compounded by an ongoing dispute between the applicant and Mr Ahmad as to payment of Mr Ahmad’s fees and his threat, implied or actual, to withdraw his services. In any event, Mr Ahmad says the “request” he made at the Tribunal occurred “a couple of weeks” before the hearing date of 9 July 2013. He puts no file note of his conversation before this Court. The uncontroversial evidence of the applicant is that the Tribunal has no file note of any such conversation with Mr Ahmad. Further, Mr Ahmad says that he did not attend the hearing himself on 9 July 2013 which I am asked to accept as corroboration of the applicant’s claim of not being told of the failed adjournment request.  The applicant was also confident and generally consistent in his evidence. He says simply that he gave instructions to the agent to request an adjournment and that he heard nothing more until advised of the determination of the Tribunal via Mr Ahmad’s email of 15 July 2013. He says that he assumed the hearing to have been adjourned. Neither witness retreated under vigorous cross-examination. Mr Ahmad’s evidence suffers from a lack of corroboration when such should have been available to him from the Tribunal’s records and from his own file notes which are mandatory under the requirements of his licence. I accept his evidence that he made general enquiries only as to the prospects of an adjournment. I am satisfied that he did not make a formal application for an adjournment on behalf of the applicant. I find on the balance of probabilities that he did not advise the applicant as to the results of those enquiries and that the hearing would proceed on 9 July 2013. I generally accept the applicant’s evidence that he has assumed (perhaps presumptuously) that an adjournment had been obtained on his behalf and that the hearing would not proceed on 9 July 2013. The salient issue is, of course, the motivation of Mr Ahmad, if any, in the scenario as set out in the above findings of fact. This requires further findings of fact and credit and I deal with these below. Secondly, I accept the applicant’s evidence that his options as to reference to the Minister or Judicial Review were not made clear to him, or more particularly, the time limits that apply for the lodgement of a judicial review. The wording of the agent’s email of 15 July 2013 is open to the interpretation claimed by the applicant. Certainly that email does not set out the time restrictions. If the word “than” in that email is accepted as a typographical error of “then”, it would be perfectly reasonable for the applicant to understand that he had two further options of review without time constraint. Consequently, again on the balance of probabilities, I accept this as the applicant’s explanation for not lodging his application to this Court within the prescribed time limits. The question of whether such an explanation is acceptable, however, requires a further consideration on the authorities and separately as to whether I find the agent’s behaviour to constitute a fraud on the Tribunal. The authorities on this point impose a heavy onus on an applicant to be diligent themselves and not necessarily rely on advice of third parties, negligent or otherwise. As Foster J observed in SZSDA v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship and Refugee review Tribunal:[3]In the present case there is no satisfactory explanation for the delay. Whilst one may have considerable sympathy for a litigant in person who does not know that he may have a capacity to bring a judicial review application in the Federal Magistrates Court and therefore fails to do so within the stipulated time frame, ignorance of those requirements (without more) is generally not regarded as a satisfactory explanation for delay.  In this matter the applicant has been involved in the process from the application to the Delegate and through the merits review to the Tribunal. He says that he was active and interested in his participation. Cross-examination elicited from him some previous association with lawyers. The email from Mr Ahmad spoke of “options” and although he was not told of time limits, the above authority, in my view, emphasises the obligation on an applicant in respect of reasonable enquiries. The applicant simply presumed the hearing to be adjourned. He did not receive confirmation. Similarly, he made no personal direct enquiries to clear the ambiguities in the agent’s email. He remained completely passive at all times in the fact of what may have been negligent or incompetent representation. It follows that I do not accept as adequate or reasonable the applicant’s explanation for the delay in bringing this application. There is an obvious prejudice to the applicant in not granting him the indulgence sought, however, time limitations are not arbitrary and are set with a view to the prudent and proper administration of justice.[4] Further, I am willing to accept a prejudice to the public purse in matters such as these where there is a delay in the administration of justice. In any event, whilst the potential prejudice to the applicants of not acceding to this application is clear, such is not determinative of an application for an indulgence of the Court and the discretion of the Court is to be exercised by consideration and weighing of all factors. I turn to consider the merits of the applicant’s substantive claim as against each ground of complaint in his amended application. Ground One- Third party fraud- the second respondent committed a jurisdictional error in that it acted pursuant to a process compromised by “third party fraud”.  The applicant here argues that the Act at ss.425 and 426A requires the Tribunal to invite an applicant to attend the hearing but if the invitation is not taken up then the Tribunal may proceed to make its determination absent the applicant. The applicant says that he asked his agent to adjourn the hearing which is an agreed fact. He says that the agent failed to act on his instructions and did not tell the applicant that the hearing had not been adjourned. Whilst conceding the Tribunal to be blameless, the applicant argues that this is a fraud perpetrated on the Tribunal given that it acts on the presumption of regularity and would assume that its invitation to attend had properly and unambiguously been conveyed to the applicant. I have, of course, found on the balance of probabilities that:i) The applicant did instruct his agent to obtain an adjournment; ii) No formal application was made for an adjournment- although I accept the agent’s evidence that he made general enquiries as to the possibility of an adjournment; iii) The hearing date was not adjourned; iv) The applicant was not informed or, at least unambiguously informed, that an adjournment was not available and that the hearing date would remain; v) The applicant had expressed a desire to and intended to attend at the hearing; and vi) That the hearing proceeded in the applicant’s absence.  Counsel for the applicant referred the Court to a useful and lengthy summary of the relevant fraud principles provided by the Full Court in SZSXT v Minister for Immigration and Border Protection[5] which references the principles proffered by the High Court in SZFDE v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship.[6] The Full Court in SZSXT at [51-52] observes:[51] SZFDE establishes the following principles (omitting case references): (a) in the framework of general legal principle, fraud can come in various guises and is “infinite in variety” [8]; (b) different considerations may arise when fraud is alleged in a public law case, which involves the due administration of Commonwealth laws and has an important constitutional underpinning in Ch III of the Constitution [11]; (c) “fraud” can attract different meanings in private and public law and in the latter context has been used in a broad sense which encompasses “bad faith” [17]; (d) in a case seeking certiorari based on the fraud of a third party, there is no requirement that one of the parties to the litigation be privy to the fraud [20]; (e) another practical aspect of fraud in public law which may set it apart from fraud in civil law is that “often a victim of it will have no useful remedy except to have the fraudulently affected result set aside and a fresh untainted hearing conducted” [22]; (f) in a public law case, fraud is not limited to that of a decision-maker, a party or a party’s representative [25]-[27]; and (g) there was no necessity in SZFDE to determine at large and in generally applicable terms the scope for judicial review for “third party fraud” of an earlier administrative decision where the judicial review applicant did not collude in the fraud and was not aware of it at the time [28]. But in the particular circumstances in SZFDE the rogue’s fraudulent dealings with the family had the effect of disabling the Tribunal from duly discharging its imperative statutory functions in conducting a review, such that there had also been a fraud “on” the Tribunal which meant that the Tribunal’s jurisdiction remained constructively unexercised [51]-[52]. [52] It is well settled that mere negligence, inadvertence or incompetence on the part of an agent representing a visa applicant will not constitute fraud so as to warrant judicial intervention. In Minister for Immigration and Citizenship v SZLIX (2008) 245 ALR 501;  [2008] FCAFC 17, the Full Court (Tamberlin, Finn and Dowsett JJ) emphasised the necessity of demonstrating that an agent’s fraud in dealing with a visa applicant has resulted directly in a fraud on the Tribunal in discharging its decision-making functions. In that case, a protection visa applicant complained that he had failed to attend an adjourned hearing of the Tribunal because his migration agent had not advised him of the hearing. The Full Court held that the evidence concerning the conduct of the agent could not support a finding of fraudulent conduct by that person which caused the visa applicant not to attend the adjourned hearing. The Full Court found that no inference could be drawn that it was the agent’s dishonest failure that resulted in the applicant not being told about the adjourned hearing and that it was equally probable that the failure was due to an error or omission on the part of the agent. At [33], the Full Court said: ... [A]n agent may be fraudulent in his dealings with a visa applicant in such a manner as results directly in a fraud on the tribunal in relation to the due discharge of its Div 4 of Pt 7 functions. SZFDE is testament to this. But SZFDE requires that the agent in question is fraudulent in a way that effects (sic) the tribunal’s Pt 7 decision-making process. An omission to notify the date of a hearing to a visa applicant may have adverse consequences for that applicant if, as here, the tribunal proceeds to make a decision under s 426A in the applicant’s absence. But before that omission can properly be said to have occasioned a fraud on the tribunal, it must itself be able properly to be characterised as a fraudulent omission vis-a-vis the visa applicant: SZFDE at [51]. The simple fact of a failure to inform or bare negligence or inadvertence will not necessarily be sufficient to give rise to fraud on the tribunal. As we have indicated, particularly having regard to the level of satisfaction required by Briginshaw v Briginshaw[1938] HCA 34;  (1938) 60 CLR 336 at 363 and 368; [1938] HCA 34;  [1938] ALR 334 at 342-3 and 344-5 in cases where fraud is alleged, we do not consider that it was open to his Honour to infer fraud.  Counsel for the applicant says that the agent’s omission here can constitute fraudulent conduct. It is here that the evidence and arguments in respect of the agent’s own professional status assumes relevance on the applicant’s case. The applicant says that it is open to the Court to find, on the balance of probabilities, that the agent’s own questionable status, including trading under the umbrella of a deregistered or insolvent corporate entity, would motivate this agent to avoid personal scrutiny before the Tribunal and hence not advise the applicant of the hearing date proceeding. This is to be viewed within the context of a continuing professional relationship between the applicant and the agent where threats of termination of that relationship had not eventuated and which therefore carry code of conduct obligations for the agent. Counsel for the respondent in arguing against a finding of fraud on the Tribunal drew attention to the policy considerations noted by the High Court in SZFDE (supra) differentiating between fraud and behaviour categorised by negligence, inadvertence, and incompetence or similar. It is only when the applicant proves fraud to the requisite satisfaction that stultification of the Tribunal’s process and hence jurisdictional error occurs. The High Court in SZFDE (supra) at [53] states:The significance of the outcome in this appeal should not be misunderstood. The appeal has turned upon the particular importance of the provisions of Div 4 of Pt 7 of the Act for the conduct by the Tribunal of reviews and the place therein of the ss 425 and 218346&sr=1370\">426A. In the Full Court French J correctly emphasised that there are sound reasons of policy why a person whose conduct before an administrative tribunal has been affected, to the detriment of that person, by bad or negligent advice or some other mishap should not be heard to complain that the detriment vitiates the decision made.   Counsel for the respondent also refers the Court to statements of the Full Court in SZLHP v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship & Anor[7] at [36] where their Honours, under a heading “The need for care when making findings of fraud” say:This case highlights the need, when making findings of fraud in matters arising in the area of public law, for judicial officers to heed the admonition of French J in Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v SZFDE [2006] FCAFC 142;  (2006) 154 FCR 365 at  [74] which was cited with approval by the High Court in SZFDE v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] HCA 35;  (2007) 232 CLR 189 at  [41] (SZFDE). French J’s admonition is to be found in the penultimate sentence of [74] where his Honour said: The learned Magistrate found that SZFDE and her family were dissuaded from attending the hearing because of “the fraudulent behaviour of Mr Hussain”. The learned Magistrate did not, at that point in his reasoning, expressly identify the fraudulent behaviour which had that effect... It is unfortunate in that in this important respect the learned Magistrate did not spell out his findings of fact clearly. The finding of fraud should have specified, in one place in the reasons, what was said that was fraudulent, how it was fraudulent, and how it was acted upon.  In the matter now before me, the applicant’s argument rests on there being an element of dishonesty and fraud in the agent’s behaviour. That assertion being made by the applicant, evidence must be given or adduced to support such a finding on the balance of probabilities. I am, however, unable to make that finding of fact. I note again my findings above, including that the agent went only so far as to “test the waters” of an adjournment possibility without any formal application. I cannot be satisfied that the agent advised the applicant unambiguously that the hearing would proceed on 9 July 2013 and I say so taking into account both an e-mail of 19 June 2013 and a telephone conversation of 2 July 2013 between the agent and the applicant. There are other equally plausible explanations for the agent’s behaviour including negligence, inadvertence or simply language confusion. The material in respect of the applicant’s professional status does not assist me as to motive. Mr Ahmad’s evidence indicated his continuing practice as a migration agent and he gave a plausible explanation as to his umbrella of companies and/or business names under which he has operated. There are no results before me of any investigation by MARA. I also note the evidence of both Mr Ahmad and the applicant of their preparedness to attend at the hearing before the Tribunal at the earlier date in April 2013 when the hearing was adjourned by the Tribunal. This would seem to mitigate against any personal motive of Mr Ahmad to avoid scrutiny and to have perpetrated a fraud. Consequently, I cannot be satisfied as to the requisite standard of proof of any dishonesty or fraud in the agent. I cannot therefore find a fraud on the Tribunal in the sense contemplated by the decision in SZFDE (supra). Ground Two- The second respondent erred by failing to consider an integer of the applicant’s claim namely that he would be targeted because of his actual or imputed political opinion.  The applicant argues that he made a claim of fear of harm because of his political views and associations through his uncle. He provided the Tribunal with a lengthy 11 page written statement (CB 37). He provided corroborating documents in respect of the claim.  The applicant argues that the Tribunal’s reasons do not disclose that it engaged with the claim on the evidence. Rather, he says, the Tribunal reasoned that the applicant’s non-attendance meant that his credibility could not be tested and hence his claim was dismissed. The applicant says that the Tribunal in any event had an obligation to engage and consider his claim and its supporting evidence and in not doing so it fell into jurisdictional error. The obligation on a Tribunal to engage and consider an applicant’s claim is well established and the failure to consider a relevant matter can cause a Tribunal to fall into jurisdictional error.[8]  The applicant’s claim is detailed in the Tribunal’s reasons at [9] and the corroborating documents at [16].  At [22] the Tribunal observes, citing authority:The mere fact that a person claims fear of persecution for a particular reason does not establish either the genuineness of the asserted fear or that it is “well-founded” or that it is for the reason claimed. It remains for the applicants to satisfy the Tribunal that all of the statutory elements are made out. Although the concept of onus of proof is not appropriate to administrative inquiries and decision-making, the relevant facts of the individual case will have to be supplied by the applicant himself or herself, in as much detail as is necessary to enable the examiner to establish the relevant facts. A decision-maker is not required to make the applicant’s case for him or her. Nor is the Tribunal required to accept uncritically any and all the allegations made by an applicant. (MIEA v Guo & Anor  (1997) 191 CLR 559 at 596, Nagalingam v MILGEA [1992] FCA 470;  (1992) 38 FCR 191, Prasad v MIEA [1985] FCA 47;  (1985) 6 FCR 155 at 169-70.)  At [23] the Tribunal summarises the applicant’s claim and at [24] notes the applicant’s non-appearance and that his claims are “largely bare assertions” not able to be tested with the application. Notably, these matters were pre-empted with the applicant prior to the hearing with the Tribunal advising that it was unable to make a favourable decision on the application on the material before it and inviting the applicant to attend at the hearing. It is clear, therefore, that the Tribunal rejected the application on the basis of the material before it rather than on the non-appearance of the applicant [27]. Counsel for the respondent refers the Court to a decision of the High Court in Minister for Immigration and Citizenship v SZMDS[9] (Crennan and Bell JJ) where their Honours note:However, the correct approach is to ask whether it was open to the Tribunal to engage in the process of reasoning in which it did engage and to make the findings it did make on the material before it.  In this matter the Tribunal clearly did engage the material before it, noting it as “largely bare assertions” I see this as a conclusive statement made by a Tribunal charged with attributing weight. The Tribunal then sought the attendance of the applicants to test the claims. It is for the applicant to provide the evidence for consideration. The Tribunal is not obliged to simply accept the applicant’s claims and evidence. The statement of “bare assertions” shows an engagement. The subsequent dismissal of the application represents an exercise of discretion open to the Tribunal. I reject the argument that the application was dismissed because of the non-attendance of the applicant. I am satisfied that there was engagement with the evidence. Consequently, I find no merit in this ground of complaint. Ground Three- the second respondent erred in the exercise of its discretion in s.426A of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth).  S.426A of the Act provides that if the applicant is invited to appear before the Tribunal and does not appear then the Tribunal may make a decision on the review without taking further action. Subsection (2), however, retains a discretion in the Tribunal to reschedule the hearing or delay its decision to enable an applicant a further opportunity to appear. I accept the submission of the applicant’s Counsel that the discretion should not be exercised unreasonably or capriciously.[10] The applicant argues that the Tribunal here should have been alerted by the applicant’s non-appearance on 9 July 2013. The applicant had provided a Response to the hearing invitation indicating his intention to attend (together with the other applicants) at the first listing of the hearing and that he would be requiring an interpreter. He said that he would be calling two witnesses. It is further argued that (on my finding of fact) Mr Ahmad had made a general enquiry to the Tribunal as to the possibility of an adjournment and that this might have further altered the Tribunal of the intentions of the applicant and therefore of something being amiss by his non-appearance. Nevertheless, a second notice inviting the applicant to appear was given in this matter and one specifically in respect of the second listing on 9 July 2013. The applicant did not respond to that invitation. Secondly, accepting that Mr Ahmad had made only general contact and enquiring with the Tribunal regarding the possibility of an adjournment, there is no evidence of any matters specific to these applicants being placed before the Tribunal, even informally, to suggest any incapacity to attend on 9 July 2013. Thirdly, the Tribunal was appraised of the fact that the applicant had not attended at an interview before the Delegate. All of these matters mitigate against an argument of consistent active participation by the applicants and are factors which would properly and reasonably impact on the discretion of the Tribunal in deciding to proceed in the absence of the applicant. As such, I do not find that the Tribunal fell into error in the exercise of its discretion and this ground of complaint must therefore fail. Ground Four – the second respondent erred unreasonably in refusing an adjournment request.  Counsel for the applicants in her oral submissions properly left it for the Court to make findings of fact and credit following the oral evidence in cross-examination of the applicant and his agent, Mr Ahmad. This ground of complaint is founded on the Court finding Mr Ahmad did make an application for an adjournment (which of course is not the applicant’s primary position). However, I did not make that finding. Rather, I accepted the evidence of Mr Ahmad that he simply made a general enquiry as to the possibility of the matter being adjourned or, as put during submissions, to “test the waters”. This being my finding, there was no adjournment application for the Tribunal to consider and I note that none is referenced in its reasons or from the applicant’s search of the RRT file. There can therefore be no merit in this ground. Conclusion.  Consequently, in respect of this application for an extension of time, I find no merit in the applicant’s substantive application. I am also not satisfied as to the adequacy of the explanation for the delay in bringing the application. Whilst there will be an obvious prejudice to the applicant on the refusal of the indulgence that he seeks, I am not satisfied in this matter that the application for an extension of time should be granted. The application will therefore be dismissed.I certify that the preceding forty-nine (49) paragraphs are a true copy of the reasons for judgment of Judge McGuireDate:  29 July 2015 [1] Tran v Minister for Immigration and Border Protection [2014] FCA533 at [38].[2] Transcript of evidence ,25 March 2015 at pg 43, line 10.[3] [2012] FCA 139 at  [38][4] Brisbane South Regional Health Authority v Taylor [1996] HCA 25;  (1996) 186 CLR 541 at  [552-553] [5] [2014] FCAFC 40[6] [2007] HCA 35 [7] [2008] FCAFC152[8] Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Yusuf  [2001] HCA 30[9] (2010) HCA 16[10] NBBL v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs  [2006] FCA 1045        ',\n",
       " 'MZAAX v Minister for Immigration & Anor [2015] FCCA 1789 (30 June 2015)': \" Introduction  This is an application for review of a decision made by the Refugee Review Tribunal (“the tribunal”). In that decision, the tribunal affirmed a decision of the delegate not to grant the applicant a protection visa.  This matter was heard with MZAAY (by his litigation guardian) v Minister for Immigration & Anor MLG337 of 2014. The applicant’s claims  The applicant arrived on Christmas Island on 5 June 2012 as an irregular maritime arrival.  He said in a statutory declaration made on 21 August 2012 that: he was a Tamil male Hindu from the northwest province of Sri Lanka; he was born on the 20 October 1996 and was thus 15 years old; his father had been in hiding for many years in Mullativu; two of his older sisters were missing; his mother went to live with his father in Mullativu and left the applicant with his sister and her husband in Uddapu; one day, the applicant was stopped by soldiers who said he should be working for the army lifting rocks; they hit him on the head but let him go; neighbours told him later that the army was coming to the house looking for him; the CID came to the applicant’s house looking for his father and threatened to kidnap the applicant because they could not find his father; his house was attacked by greasemen one night; the applicant’s mother arranged for him to be taken by boat to Australia; the applicant feared that if he returned to Sri Lanka he would be killed by the CID; and he would not be safe in Mullativu because there are landmines there. The Tribunal’s reasons The tribunal noted that there were numerous inconsistencies in the evidence given by the applicant. Even allowing for the applicant’s youth and other vulnerabilities, the tribunal considered that the applicant’s account of past events was not credible. More particularly, and for detailed reasons which it gave, the tribunal did not accept that the applicant’s father had been suspected by the CID to be involved with the LTTE or that the applicant himself had been interrogated by the CID or forced to work for the army. The tribunal noted that the applicant was 17 years old at the time of its decision.  The tribunal considered the vulnerabilities inherent in the applicant’s youth.   However, the tribunal formed the view that the applicant could return to the care of his sister in Uddapu and would not face serious harm in Sri Lanka for reasons connected with his age. The tribunal considered that the risk of harm from greasemen was purely speculative. The tribunal did not accept that the applicant would be imputed with an adverse political opinion because he was a failed asylum seeker or for any other reason. The tribunal considered that any detriment that the applicant might suffer as result of departing Sri Lanka illegally would be the result of a law of general application that would be applied indiscriminately.  Consequently, the tribunal did not accept that any such detriment would be for a Convention reason. In relation to complementary protection, the tribunal considered that any harm that the applicant might experience in the context of being held on remand briefly as a result of his illegal departure from Sri Lanka would not amount to significant harm as defined in the Migration Act 1958.  In so concluding, the tribunal accepted that the prisons in Sri Lanka do not meet international standards as a result of overcrowding, poor sanitary facilities, limited access to food and an absence of basic assistance mechanisms. Ground of application  The ground of review in the application filed on 26 February 2014 and amended on 5 March 2015 is:  The Tribunal’s decision dated 29 January 2014 (the “Tribunal’s decision”) is affected by jurisdictional error because the Tribunal failed to take into account a relevant consideration or did not otherwise perform its statutory task.  Particulars (a) In making its decision, the Tribunal was obliged, but failed, to address a claim made by the applicant to be owed protection obligations and, in particular, his claim that, as an unaccompanied youth, he would face a real chance of serious or significant harm upon any return to Sri Lanka because there was a real chance that: (i) due to his unlawful departure from Sri Lanka, he would be prosecuted by the Sri Lankan authorities and, during (and possibly after) any such prosecution, he would be imprisoned; and (ii) during any imprisonment, he would be detained with adult offenders, including sex offenders and other offenders, and, as a consequence, might suffer physical or sexual assault or other mistreatment at the hands of those fellow prisoners. Essentially, the applicant argued that the tribunal failed to consider that the applicant, as a minor, might be imprisoned with adult sex and other offenders and might be mistreated by them.  The applicant argued that this claim was raised expressly or arose from the materials.  The first respondent argued that the claim was not made expressly and did not arise from the materials.  Alternatively, the first respondent submitted that the claim, if any, was dealt with in findings of greater generality.   The applicant submitted that the claim was raised in the following places: at CB9,  in the record of the applicant’s entry interview, where he said in answer to a question asking who was the “we” he alleged had no safety in Sri Lanka, “Me and minors, children ...”; at CB67, in paragraph 2 of the applicant’s statutory declaration made on 21 August 2012, where the applicant said that he was a young Tamil from the northwest province; at CB191, in a submission dated 12 April 2013 from RILC to the tribunal, where it was said that the applicant feared harm based on:  His membership of the particular social group ‘unaccompanied minor Tamil asylum seekers/returnees who have fled Sri Lanka unlawfully’ ... ; at CB279, in a submission dated 5 May 2013 from RILC to the tribunal, where a United States Department of State report dated 19 April 2013 concerning prison conditions was quoted as follows:  In some cases juveniles were not held separately from adults.  Pretrial detainees often were not held separately from those convicted.  Petty criminals and sexual offenders often were incarcerated with perpetrators of more serious crimes ... ; at CB281, in the same submission, where RILC said:  It is submitted that [the applicant] faces a real chance/risk of being detained for a long period of time, not simply the amount of time it will take a Magistrates’ Court to reconvene, and that he will be subjected to prison conditions which do not meet international standards, may be detained with adults including sex offenders and as a Tamil male may be physically and sexually assaulted or tortured by Sri Lankan authorities. (emphasis added) ...  We submit that given the applicant’s young age and the extremely poor prison conditions in Sri Lanka, any period of detention could amount to serious/significant harm especially given information that children are not always separated from adults including adults who have been convicted of offences ... ; and at CB313 to CB314, in a post hearing written submission dated 26 November 2013 from RILC to the tribunal: where RILC said:  As submitted previously, the conditions of overcrowding, denial of food, solitary confinement, and poor provision of sanitary facilities amounts to cruel and inhuman treatment according to international jurisprudence; and where a UK Human Rights and Democracy Report said:  Remand prisoners and those imprisoned on minor offences are also held in the same facilities as more serious offenders. It should be noted that the preamble to the passage quoted above from CB191 referred to harm:  at the hands of the Sri Lankan authorities, or pro-government military or paramilitary groups ...There was no mention in CB191 of the applicant suffering harm as a young Tamil male at the hands of other prisoners.  The tribunal dealt with the issue of the applicant’s youth in a number of places in its reasons for decision. The tribunal said, at paragraphs 72 and 73, under the heading, “The applicant’s young age”:  72. The applicant departed Sri Lanka in 2012 aged fifteen and is seventeen years old at the time of the Tribunal’s decision.  While the UNHCR Guidelines identify children in certain circumstances as being potentially in need of international refugee protection, the Tribunal is not satisfied that the circumstances referred to in those Guidelines are relevant to the applicant’s circumstances, noting that they pertain to former child soldiers, children at risk of sexual violence or exploitation or children at risk of underage marriage or child labour.  There is nothing in the evidence before the Tribunal to suggest that the applicant fits any of these profiles.  73. While the Tribunal accepts that there are vulnerabilities inherent in the applicant’s young age, it notes the applicant’s evidence that he remained in the care of his sister in Uddapu up until his departure from Sri Lanka in 2012 and that remains in contact with his sister as well as his mother in Mullaithivu. The Tribunal notes the applicant’s claims that his parents are now unwell and cannot care for him, but is satisfied that the applicant could return to the care of his sister in Uddapu.  The Tribunal does not accept the applicant’s claim that he has been prevented from going to school, rather for the reasons set out above it has found that he attended school in Uddapu until departing Sri Lanka in June 2012.  In these circumstances the Tribunal does not accept there to be a real chance that the applicant would face serious harm on the basis of his young age if he returns to Sri Lanka, now or in the reasonably foreseeable future. Under a heading in relation to political opinion, the tribunal said, at paragraphs 77 and 82:  77. The Tribunal has considered the submission that the applicant’s young age, male gender, Tamil ethnicity and place of origin being a Tamil dominated area would put the applicant at risk of harm.  While the Tribunal accepts that the applicant is a young Tamil male from Udappu who has also spent a short period of time with his parents in Mullaithivu, it does not accept there to be a real chance that he would be imputed with a pro-LTTE or anti political opinion for these reasons alone.  In making this assessment the Tribunal has had regard to the UNHCR 2012 Guidelines which indicate that there is no longer a need for group-based protection mechanisms or for a presumption of eligibility for Sri Lankans of Tamil ethnicity originating from the north of the country.  The Tribunal considers those guidelines suggest that being Tamil alone is not automatically indicative or suggestive of risk in Sri Lanka, and that regard to personal circumstances is important in assessing the chances of harm to the applicant due to his race.  For the same reasons, the Tribunal does not accept there to be a real chance that the applicant will be imputed with a political opinion opposed to the current Sri Lankan government because of his status as a young Tamil boy (child) from North West or Udappu or a young Tamil who is perceived to have family living in Mullaithivu or any other formulation based on his young age, his male gender, his Tamil ethnicity, place of origin or his parent’s residence.  ...  82. For these reasons the Tribunal does not accept there to be a real chance the applicant will face serious harm on the basis of his membership of the particular social group ‘failed asylum seekers’ or ‘unaccompanied minor Tamil asylum seekers/ returnees who have fled Sri Lanka unlawfully’, having regard to its findings about failed (sic) the applicant’s age, failed asylum seekers and returnees set out elsewhere in this decision.   More relevantly, the tribunal found at paragraphs 85 and following that: At paragraph 85, the applicant left Sri Lanka illegally and contrary to the Immigrants and Emigrants Act of 2006 (Sri Lanka) (“IEA”); at paragraph 86, it was likely that he would be questioned on his return, but such questioning would not amount to persecution, even taking into account the applicant’s youth; at paragraph 87, there was a real chance that the applicant would be prosecuted under the IEA; at paragraph 88, any such prosecution would be pursuant to a law of general application applied indiscriminately and would therefore not constitute Convention persecution; at paragraph 89, the applicant would not face disproportionate treatment from the authorities as a young Tamil male from the north; at paragraphs 90 to 93 and 95, there was a real chance that the applicant would be held on remand for a few days but a remote chance that he would be held for longer than that; at paragraph 94, the chance of the applicant being sentenced to a term of imprisonment on conviction was remote; and at paragraph 95, the applicant’s family would be able to pay any fine imposed on the applicant. Most significantly, the tribunal said at paragraph 96:  The Tribunal has considered the available country information in relation to the circumstances of individuals who are held in prison in Sri Lanka.  The Tribunal notes the reports of torture and assault of Tamil prisoners in Sri Lanka, however it considers that independent sources indicate that it is Tamil prisoners who otherwise had a profile of being supporters of the LTTE or otherwise opposed to the current Sri Lankan government who are targeted in this way.  The Tribunal does not accept that the applicant faces a real chance of being seriously harmed because he is Tamil, or of being treated more harshly than non-Tamil prisoners, while he is imprisoned on remand for a few days after his return to Sri Lanka. In making this assessment the Tribunal has had regard to its findings elsewhere in this decision as to his vulnerability arising out of his youth. Under the heading, “Complementary protection”, the tribunal found at paragraph 107, the questioning the applicant would face under the IEA would not amount to significant harm, even having regard to his youth and associated vulnerability. More relevantly, the tribunal said at paragraph 108:  108. In relation to the treatment the applicant may face while held in prison in Sri Lanka, the available country information shows prison conditions in Sri Lanka do not meet international standards as a result of overcrowding, poor sanitary facilities, limited access to food and an absence of basic assistance mechanisms. As required by the Ministerial direction referred to above, the Tribunal has taken into account the relevant guidance in the PAMS in relation to the circumstances in which harsh detention conditions may amount to significant harm. The Tribunal has also considered the impact of such detention on the applicant given his young age and state of health and the decision of this Tribunal (differently constituted) that is said to be relevant to the decision of this Tribunal.   However the Tribunal in this case is required to consider the particular circumstances of the applicant before it.  On the evidence before it, the Tribunal is not satisfied that being in overcrowded conditions with limited access to basic facilities for a few days while on remand would, in the applicant's particular circumstances, amount cumulatively to a level of severity of treatment that amounts to a serious or systematic deprivation of his human dignity, cause him pain and suffering that can be characterised as “cruel or inhuman treatment or punishment,” or cause him extreme humiliation that constitutes “degrading treatment or punishment” or cause him “severe pain or suffering” that could be characterised as torture, or any other form of significant harm.  It is well established that the tribunal:  ...is not required to consider a case that is not expressly made or does not arise clearly on the materials before it.[1] It is clear that the applicant did not expressly raise the claim that he might suffer sexual or physical assault or other mistreatment at the hands of other prisoners.  There was an express claim that the applicant might be physically and sexually assaulted or tortured while in prison by Sri Lankan authorities.  However, it was not suggested that the tribunal did not deal with that claim. I am not persuaded that the claim that the applicant might suffer sexual or physical assault or other mistreatment at the hands of other prisoners clearly arose on the materials before the tribunal.  The court was not taken to any country information that was before the tribunal that suggested that 17 year old males held on remand for a few days in Sri Lanka were at risk of physical or sexual assault by other prisoners.  In my view, that risk does not clearly emerge from the material that was before the tribunal.  It is a matter of common knowledge that prisoners sometimes physically and sexually assault other prisoners.  However, there was nothing in the material before the tribunal that suggested that such events occur with such frequency in Sri Lankan prisons that the applicant would face a real risk of that happening to him in the few days that the tribunal considered that he would be held in remand.  In any event, there is authority that, where an applicant is professionally represented, as here, the tribunal is only obliged to consider those claims that are expressly articulated: SZRKY v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship & Anor  (2013) 141 ALD 328;  [2013] FCA 352 at  [14], SZRPA v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship & Anor [2012] FCA 962 at  [10], [26] and [32], and SZSHK v Minister for Immigration and Border Protection & Anor (2013) 138 ALD 26;  [2013] FCAFC 125 at  [37].  In view of that authority, the fact that the applicant did not expressly raise the claim now sought to be agitated is sufficient to dispose of the matter. For completeness, I would also add that I am not persuaded that, if the claim had been raised, the tribunal’s general findings would have been adequate.  The claim now sought to be raised is of a very specific nature and it would have required very specific assessment.  The tribunal’s reference to overcrowding and so on would not have been sufficient to deal with a squarely raised claim of physical or sexual assault by other prisoners. I would also add that the applicant is now 18 years old.  Even if there had been a jurisdictional error as alleged, there would be a question whether the matter should be remitted to the tribunal in circumstances where the applicant is no longer a minor.  It is true that the applicant is still a very young man. However, the concerns about him being held in an adult prison would seem to have diminished.  He no longer needs a litigation guardian. Conclusion  For the reasons given above, the application must be dismissed with costs. I will hear the parties on the amount of costs, given that this matter was heard in conjunction with MZAAY.I certify that the preceding twenty-four (24) paragraphs are a true copy of the reasons for judgment of Judge RileyAssociate:  Date:  30 June 2015 [1] NABE v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs & Anor (No 2) (2004) 144 FCR 1;  (2004) 219 ALR 27;  [2004] FCAFC 263 at  [61]       \",\n",
       " 'MZADT v Minister for Immigration & Anor [2015] FCCA 2702 (29 October 2015)': '  This is an application for judicial review pursuant section 476 of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) (“the Act”) of a decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal (as it then was) (“the Tribunal”) affirming a determination of the Minister’s delegate not to grant a Protection (Class XA) Visa (“the visa”) pursuant to section 65. Background.  The applicant is a Shia Pashtun Muslim.  He is from the Bangash Tribe with associations through his mother and wife to the Turi Tribe from the Kurram Agency in Pakistan. The applicant’s claims for a protection visa can be summarised from his own submissions and materials as follows: (i)   He is a Pashtun and Shia Muslim.  He is a member of the Bangash Tribe from Kurram Agency Pakistan.  His mother and wife are members of the Turi Tribe;(ii)  Shias other than those from Kurram Agency being Hazaras or Punjabis hold animosity towards the Pashtun; (iii) Pashtun outside of Kurram Agency are Sunni and reject Shias; (iv) Those of the Bangash and Turi Tribes are opposed to and reject the Taliban; (v) The applicant had previously worked in Rawalpindi.  His experience was of isolation and being cautious in approaching strangers; (vi) During this period the applicant would travel back to Kurram Agency each two to three months to visit his family; (vii) The applicant was unwelcome at mosques in Rawalpindi by reason of being a Shia and/or Pashtun; (viii) In April 2007 there was war in Kurram Agency resulting in the roads between Parachinar and Pershawar being blocked by the Taliban with attacks and murder of Shias.  On 17 August 2012 the applicant completed an Irregular Maritime Arrival Entry interview.  He deposed to being a Pashtun of Shia religion from Parachinar.  He sought protection on account of danger from the Taliban, snipers and bomb blasts together with IGDs on the roads. The Minister’s delegate refused the application on 18 July 2013.  The applicant lodged a merits review application with the Tribunal on 26 August 2013.  The applicant appeared at the hearing on 29 November 2013.  The Tribunal had before it, at the hearing, additional RRT country advice including: (i)  That Shiite Pashtuns had possibly developed a group identity based on religion and tribe/clan and traditionally resided in Kurram Agency or Orakazi Agency areas of Pakistan; (ii) There was a history of conflict with Sunni Pashtuns who are the overwhelming majority of the population; (iii) That almost all Shias in Pakistan are non-Pashtuns and that it is unlikely that the applicant would be able to relocate or resettle with a Shia community. The Tribunal affirmed the delegate’s decision on 3 April 2014. The applicant now relies on an amended application to this Court filed 17 November 2014, which raises four grounds of complaint as follows: (1) The Tribunal engaged in jurisdictional error by failing to consider a claim before it: Particulars:  (a) The Tribunal did not consider the claim before it that the applicant faced a well-founded fear of persecution or significant harm while travelling on the roads in Pakistan;  (b) The Tribunal did not consider the claim before it that, were the applicant to return to Pakistan and relocate to Rawalpindi, he held a well-founded fear of persecution because he would periodically travel on the roads to see his family in the Kurram Agency (ie travel along the roads where he held a well-founded fear to an area where he held a well-founded fear). (2) The Tribunal engaged in jurisdictional error by failing to consider a claim before it or by failing to ask itself the right question. Particulars  (a) The Tribunal did not ask itself whether the applicant faced a well-founded fear of persecution in the process of travelling to Rawalpindi.    (b) The Tribunal did not ask itself what risks the applicant would face were he to travel to Rawalpindi upon his return and whether relocation was reasonably practicable in light of these risks. (3) The Tribunal engaged in jurisdictional error by failing to ask itself the right question. Particulars  (a) The Tribunal applied in the internal relocation principle, yet did not reject the propositions that, upon his return to Pakistan the applicant would travel along the roads between Rawalpindi and the Kurram Agency to see his family and that such travel could give rise to a well-founded fear of persecution or significant harm.  (b) Despite the circumstance set out in subparagraph (a), the Tribunal nevertheless failed to ask itself whether the applicant could reasonably be expected to not engage in such travel that would put him at risk. (4) The Tribunal engaged in jurisdictional error by failing to deal with the claims before it or by failing to apply the correct test or applicable law. Particulars  (a) The Tribunal failed to lawfully deal with the claims before it relating to the reasonable practicability or the practical realities of the proposed relocation to Rawalpindi. The Tribunal’s decision.  The Tribunal accepted that the applicant is a Shia and a Pashtun of the Bangash Tribe from Kurram Agency.  It was accepted that the applicant faced a real chance of serious or significant harm in Kurram Agency. Relevantly to the issues here, the Tribunal at [46] and [48] noted and found:  [46] The Tribunal has considered the country information in relation to the Kurram Agency.  The violence in the region has been an ongoing occurrence since the 1980s, with upswings of violence reflecting domestic and regionally located issues.  The most recent violence began in April 2007, with a peak in 2007 and 2008, but with sporadic events occurring until present.  The Parachinar-Thall Road, the significant Pakistan land access to the Upper Kurram Agency where Parachinar is the district capital, provides a distinct example of the difficulty of the region.  Closed by militants for over four years since 2007, peace talks providing for the re-opening of the road in 2011, followed by splinter extremist groups disavowing the peace accords and conducting violent attacks on road conveys.  [48] The actual violent acts conducted may be random and sporadic, these attacks are designed to keep the people of Parachinar and the Upper Kurram region on high alert and extremely anxious about the possibility of a violent incident that will cause significant loss of life.  It is a different circumstance to the incidents of violence in Quetta City, where there is a constant threat of actualised violence, but the possibility of violent attack on civilian targets in and around Parachinar remains a realistic threat that may be carried out and may harm individuals such as the applicant. At [51] the Tribunal found:  [51] Based on this information, the Tribunal accepts that the applicant has a real chance of serious harm arising from his ethnicity and religion in the Kurram Agency.  The Tribunal considers that in the context of someone from that region of Pakistan, being a Shia will almost automatically ascribed you to being an ethic Bangash or Turi Tribe member.  While there is limited information that people are targeted specifically because of their ethnicity, the combination of the applicant’s background as a Shia Bangash or Turi from this region places the applicant is [sic] at risk of harm.  The Tribunal considers that there is a significant amount of country information about the Kurram Agency in Pakistan which supported the contention that the applicant could not return to that part of Pakistan. The Tribunal then considered whether the applicant could relocate and articulated the test at [54 -55] thus:  [54] Having determined that the applicant does have genuine fears of returning to his home region, the Tribunal is required to consider whether the applicant could reasonably relocate to a separate part of Pakistan.  Depending upon the circumstances of the particular case, it may be reasonable for a person to relocate in the country of nationality or form a habitual residence to a region where, objectively, there is no appreciable risk of the occurrence of the fear persecution. Thus a person would be excluded from refugee status if under all the circumstances it would be reasonable, in the sense of “practicable”, to expect him or her to seek refuge in another part of the same country.  What is “reasonable” in this sense must depend upon the particular circumstances of the applicant and the impact upon that person of relocation within his or her country.  However, whether relocation is reasonable is not to be judged by considering whether the quality of life in the place of relocation  meets the basic norms of civil, Political and socio-economic rights.  [55] The issue of whether it would be reasonable to expect an applicant to relocate within Pakistan only arises if the circumstances indicate that there is a region where, objectively, there is no appreciable risk of the occurrence of the fear persecution, that is, where the feared persecution is localised rather than nation-wide.  Generally speaking, it is not necessary to identify a specific place in which the applicant can relocate or live. The Tribunal considered relocation to Rawalpindi, where the applicant had previously lived. The Tribunal made a finding of fact open to it on the evidence that it did not accept that the applicant has been targeted for harm personally in Rawalpindi or that he had there been required to modify his behaviour or act in any manner to reduce his profile in Rawalpindi during his time there.  [56]. At [69-74] the Tribunal considered the second limb of the “relocation test” as to whether it would be reasonable, in all of the circumstances, for the applicant to relocate to Rawalpindi.  Given that this issue is a focus of the application before me, I have set out the Tribunal’s reasons in full as follows:  [69] Having determined that the applicant can relocate to a location where he does not face a real chance of serious harm, the Tribunal has considered whether it is reasonable in all the circumstances for the applicant to relocate to Rawalpindi.  [70] The Tribunal considers that the applicant has a relevant and extended history of living in Rawalpindi.  He has connections and has worked for a Rawalpindi company, firstly as a labourer and then as a technician.  These skills learnt, and the ability to leverage his connections for the purpose of gaining employment, provides the applicant with the ability to establish himself and his family in Rawalpindi.  While the applicant has previously lived by himself in Rawalpindi, gaining finances to support his family, given the capacity for the applicant to earn money in Rawalpindi, he would be in a position to support his family living in Rawalpindi themselves.  The applicant has also shown that he is willing to leave the family support of the home in Parachinar to establish himself in Rawalpindi.    [71] The Tribunal has also considered the effect of generalised violence in Pakistan in the context of the reasonableness of the applicant relocating within Pakistan.  Generalised violence in Pakistan occurs sporadically in a number of locations, and the Tribunal does not accept that the applicant is specifically targeted by this general violence.  The Tribunal considers that the prospect of the applicant being harmed in an incident of generalised violence within Pakistan to be one that is remote.  [72] The applicant has shown an aptitude, in his living for an extended period in locations in Pakistan outside of his home region, and the Tribunal considers that he could reasonably establish himself in another location within Pakistan.  The Tribunal considers that it is reasonable, in the sense of being practicable, for the applicant to relocate having regard to all of the circumstances.  [73] The Tribunal finds that the applicant can continue to be a practising Shia Muslim, a Bangash/Turi Tribe member, a Pashtun and a Shia Bangash/Turi from the Parachinar Region of the Kurram Agency in areas of Pakistan where he does not have a real chance of serious harm.  The Tribunal finds that there are locations in Pakistan where he will not face a real chance of serious harm.  [74] Having considered the applicant’s claims individually and cumulatively, the Tribunal is not satisfied that the applicant faces a real chance of serious harm within the entirety of Pakistan now or in the reasonably foreseeable future.  The Tribunal finds that the applicant is in a position to relocate to Rawalpindi, a location where he would not face a real chance of serious harm because of his Shia Bangash Pashtun and Parachinar background. Application to this Court  Counsel for both the applicant and the first respondent noted that the first three grounds of complaint are inherently connected and overlap and could be effectively argued together.  Essentially, the applicant argues that the Tribunal did not consider his claim as to facing harm in travelling between Rawalpindi and Kurram Agency to visit his family if he were to relocate to Rawalpindi.   Ground 4 of the complaint also overlaps to a degree with the first three grounds but specifically argues that the Tribunal did not consider the practical realities of the proposed relocation to Rawalpindi in considering whether it was reasonable for the applicant to so relocate. Grounds 1-3 The applicant says that the Tribunal did not consider his claim as a component integer that he feared persecution or significant harm when travelling on roads between Rawalpindi and Kurram Agency. The first respondent says that the applicant misconceives the nature of the Tribunal’s findings in respect of the Applicant’s claims in that the alleged danger on the roads was not an independent claim requiring the consideration of the Tribunal. That is, that the Applicant’s initial interview discloses only a general comment rather than a specific claim of fear of harm on the roads around Parachinar. Similarly, that the applicant’s Irregular Maritime Arrival Entry Interview discloses only vague references of very general threats on the roads not amounting to a claim or integer of a claim.  Still further, the respondent argues that the Applicant, in any event, claimed only to travel back to Parachinar once per year from 2007 in both his statutory declaration and in his written submissions to the Tribunal. Alternatively, the first respondent argues that in any event, the Tribunal acknowledged the applicant’s previous travel between Rawalpindi and Parachinar [38] and that the subsequent findings that the applicant would face harm in Parachinar presumably included a consideration of the harm faced by him in travel on the roads around that region. Counsel for the first respondent says that the Tribunal did not fail to ask itself the right question in relation to relocation.  Counsel argues that the Tribunal correctly applied the test and considered all relevant issues in establishing whether it be reasonable for the applicant to relocate and specifically that no evidence was put before the Tribunal regarding the applicant travelling to Rawalpindi from Australia (ground 2(b)) and that harm to him might occur. Ground 4. In respect of ground 4, the first respondent says that the Tribunal did consider the practical realities of the applicant’s proposed relocation.  In his written submissions at [21] the first respondent puts this argument succinctly as follows:  Rather, in this case, the Tribunal incorporated its detailed findings on the applicant’s experience in Rawalpindi in relation to harm [36-42] and [66-68], and then reinterpreted that information in regards to the practical realities of relocation. Generally, the first respondent relied on the authority that the Tribunal’s decision should be read as a whole and without an eye attuned for error.[1]  Consideration of the application  In Htun v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs[2] Allsop J said:  The requirement to review the decision under S414 of the Act requires the Tribunal to consider the claims of the applicant.  To make a decision without having considered all the claims is to fail to complete the exercise of jurisdiction embarked upon.  The claim or claims and it’s or their component integers are considerations made mandatory relevant by the Act for consideration ...  Further, in Dranichnikov v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs[3] Kirby J at [87-88] notes:  [87] The Court has repeatedly held that, for the issue of prohibition or mandamus, under s.75(v) of the Constitution, it is necessary to demonstrate jurisdictional error on the part of the proposed subject of such relief.  Thus, it is essential to establish something more than an error of law within jurisdictions.  Difficult as it may sometimes be to differentiate jurisdictional and non-jurisdictional error with exactitude, in a case where there has been a fundamental mistake at the threshold in expressing, and therefore considering, the legal claim propounded by an applicant, the error will be classified as an error of jurisdiction.  It will be treated as a constructive failure of the decision-maker to exercise the jurisdiction and powers given to it.  [88] Obviously, it is not every mistake in understanding the facts, in applying the law or in reasoning to a conclusion that will amount to a constructive failure to exercise jurisdiction.  But where, as here, the mistake is essentially definitional, and amounts to a basic misunderstanding of the case brought by an applicant, the resulting flaw is so serious as to undermine the lawfulness of the decision in question in a fundamental way. The obligation to consider claims includes those that are;[4](a) expressly raised;   (b) squarely raised by the material before it;  and  (c) those that are evident from the Tribunal’s own findings and conclusions.    Secondly, I accept the submissions of Counsel for the applicant that the Tribunal must do more than simply state, set out, or acknowledge the applicant’s claim.  It must consciously consider and engage with that claim.[5]  Consequently, at its most abstract, I am to consider whether the applicant set out a claim or integer of a claim such that the Tribunal was obliged to consider and engage with the claim?  Secondly, and if such a claim is evident, did the Tribunal engage with the claim?  On a consideration of the material before the Tribunal, I am persuaded that the applicant in the matter now before me did set out a claim of fearing harm or persecution by travelling on the roads around Parachinar.  In his first interview it is recorded:  A lot of danger from Taliban and snipers and bomb blasts.  Also IGDs in the roads. Secondly, in his Irregular Maritime Arrival Entry Interview at part C there is recording in a question and answer format:  ...people were getting off trucks on the way to Peshawar and Parachinar and suicide attacks happening on our people.  Sniper shootings and mostly killing our people...the other thing is that moving around in our area, going to different places from our area is very difficult and dangerous for our lives. Similarly, in his statutory declaration of 14 November 2012 at [6] and [8-9] the applicant says:  [6] I would travel back to my home to visit my family about once every two or three months and would stay with them in the Kurram Agency for about two weeks at a time.  I missed my family and my community very much and never enjoyed living away from them.  However, knowing that the risks I was taking provided my family was my main propriety.  [8] In April 2007, a war broke out in the Kurram Agency.  The roads between Parachinar and Peshawar were blocked by the Taliban and the only way to travel on them was with government escorts.  However, even the government convoys were regular attacks and Shias were murdered.  This situation caused me much grief.  I was stranded in Rawalpindi and unable to travel back to my home to visit my family.  [9] Between 2007 and 2012, I would only travel back to the Kurram Agency about once a year.  On each of those occasions, I was terrified.  I only travelled along these roads for the purposes of seeing my wife and child who I missed dearly. Also in his written submissions to the Tribunal the applicant says at [22-24]:  [22] In or around April 2007 the present bout of sectarian violence in the Kurram Agency commenced between Shia and Sunni extremist groups.  As a result, the roads leading in and out of Peshawar became increasingly dangerous due to the presence of Taliban.  Though armed government convoys were available, these convoys were regularly attacked and Shias on board were killed.  [23] The applicant is easily identified as a Shia because: (a) of his surname of (X)(also the name of Y, a descent of the Prophet Muhammad, who was killed at Kabala in Iraq 1123 years ago, and was thus denied the leadership of Muslims that Shias believe was his right);  (b) of his strict observance of Shia Islam including wearing black clothing the month Muharram and attending Shia mosques;  and (c) because his identity documentation (for example his domicile certificate) refers to him as a Bangash (Shia Muslim).  [24] Owing to the fear of harm during these journeys, the applicant reduced the frequency of his return to Kurram Agency to approximately once a year.  On these occasions the applicant risked his life compelled only because of his love for his family and children, who he missed dearly. Interconnected is the applicant’s claim that he could not reasonably relocate his family to Rawalpindi and that he would intend, if this be the case, to travel frequently to maintain those relationships. There is, therefore, in my view, a claim clearly articulated by the applicant or at least one implicit in and flowing from the Tribunal’s determination that the applicant relocate to Rawalpindi.  Further, the Tribunal itself in its reasons and as set out above has found that the applicant could not return to Kurram Agency to live because of a fear of persecution or significant harm.  The claim, therefore, that the applicant would be likely to travel back to Kurram Agency from Rawalpindi and therefore be subject to significant harm is one that could obviously be rejected by the Tribunal in its discretion in attributing weight to and balancing of the evidence.  This, however, is not the issue before me.  Rather, this applicant argues simply that there was a claim that he would face significant harm in travelling to or from Kurram Agency and that the claim has not been considered. At [70] the Tribunal in its reasons deals with the prospects of the applicant relocating his family to Rawalpindi or alternatively the applicant supporting his family from Rawalpindi whilst they remain in Kurram Agency.  Whilst these are matters properly within the Tribunal’s consideration, they do not, in my view, subsume the obligation of the Tribunal to consider and engage the claim made by the applicant in respect of travel between Rawalpindi and Kurram Agency. This is a separate and distinct claim made by the applicant and particularised as above.  Again, it is open for the Tribunal to reject that claim in all of the circumstances but only after engagement and consideration.  Put simply, the Tribunal was confronted with a claim giving it an obligation to consider the reasonableness of the applicant relocating to Rawalpindi in circumstances where he says he would travel outside of that city.  The Tribunal’s reasons do not, in my view, disclose that the claim was engaged and considered.  As such, I am of the view that the Tribunal fell into jurisdictional error. Consideration of ground 4  The applicant complains that the Tribunal failed to consider the practical realities of the proposed relocation in the context of whether it would be reasonable for this applicant to relocate to Rawalpindi. It is well established that the reasonableness of a finding that an applicant can relocate includes a consideration of the particular circumstances of the applicant in the sense of whether such relocation would be a practicable option.[6]  The applicant here argues that the Tribunal’s consideration of his circumstances were limited to the question of whether he would suffer persecution of significant harm and not to matters of practical reality.   I am not persuaded by the applicant’s argument here.  At [69] of its reasons the Tribunal says:  Having determined that the applicant can relocate to a location where he does not face a real chance of serious harm, the Tribunal has considered whether it is reasonable in all the circumstances for the applicant to relocate to Rawalpindi. Immediately thereafter the Tribunal considers the particular circumstances of the applicant thus [70]:  The Tribunal considers that the applicant has a relevant and extended history of living in Rawalpindi.  He has connections and has worked for a Rawalpindi company, first as a labourer and then as a technician.  These skills learned, and the ability to leverage his connections for the purpose of gaining employment, provides the applicant with the ability to establish himself and his family in Rawalpindi.  While the applicant has previously lived by himself in Rawalpindi, gaining finances to support his family, given the capacity for the applicant to earn money in Rawalpindi he would be in a position to support his family living in Rawalpindi themselves.  The applicant has also shown that he is willing to leave the family support of the home in Parachinar to establish himself in Rawalpindi. At [72] the consideration continues in respect of reasonableness and practicality as follows:  The applicant has shown an aptitude, in this living for an extended period in locations in Pakistan outside of his home region, and the Tribunal considers that he could reasonably establish himself in another location within Pakistan.  The Tribunal considers that it is reasonable, in the sense of being practicable, for the applicant to relocate having regard to all of the circumstances. I am of the view, therefore, that the Tribunal did specifically consider the practicalities of the applicant’s relocation in respect of reasonableness, although separately it did not engage his claim in respect of proposed travel to Kurram Agency. Conclusion  Having been satisfied that the Tribunal fell into error in not engaging and considering a claim made by the applicant, the applicant should be afforded the relief sought.I certify that the preceding forty-one (41) paragraphs are a true copy of the reasons for judgment of Judge McGuire Date: 29 October 2015 [1] Minister for Immigration and Ethic Affairs v Wu Shan Liang  (1996) 185 CLR 259 at [271-2][2] Htun v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs  [2001] FCA 1802[3] Dranichnikov v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2003] HCA 2003[4] MZWDG v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 427at  [39][5] Minister for Immigration and Border Protection v MZYTS [2013] FCAFC 114.[6] Randhawa v MILGEA [1994] FCA 1253;  (1994) 52 FCR 437 at  [442].

       " 'MZAFH & Ors v Minister for Immigration & Anor [2015] FCCA 2397 (17 August 2015)': ' (revised from the transcript)  This is an application for review of a decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal.  The applicants are a husband, wife and child.  Only the first applicant, the husband, appeared before the court today.  He appeared without the benefit of legal assistance. The first applicant claimed that he was a citizen of Lebanon.  He first arrived in Australia on 2 July 2007 on a student visa.  On 13 July 2012, the first applicant lodged an application for a protection visa.  That application was refused by a delegate of the Minister.  On 13 November 2012, the applicants sought review by the Refugee Review Tribunal.  The first applicant appeared before the Tribunal to give evidence on 18 July 2013.  The Tribunal conducted a second hearing on 28 August 2013.  At the second hearing, both the first applicant and his wife, the second applicant, gave evidence to the Tribunal.  On 21 May 2014, the Tribunal affirmed the delegate’s decision not to grant the applicants a protection visa. The first applicant claimed to fear persecution in Lebanon on the basis that he had converted from being a Sunni Muslim to being a Jehovah’s Witness.  He claimed that a university lecturer introduced him to the Jehovah’s Witness faith in Lebanon in 2005.  He said that the applicant invited the lecturer to visit him at his village.  When the first applicant’s father learned that the lecturer was a Jehovah’s Witness, the first applicant’s father assaulted the first applicant.  The lecturer advised the first applicant to leave Lebanon and go to another country.  The first applicant came to Australia two years later in 2007.  The second applicant joined the first applicant in Australia in 2009.  The third applicant was born shortly thereafter. The first applicant, at that stage, was on a student visa.  The first applicant did not pursue his religion as a Jehovah’s Witness until 2012, at which time the first applicant also lodged his application for a protection visa.  The first applicant claimed that he did not know where to go to practice his religion and also claimed that he did not want to do anything that would cause his wife not to join him in Australia.  The first applicant claimed that between 2007 and 2012 he continued attending a mosque for fear of being reported to his father.  The first applicant claimed that he had been attending Jehovah’s Witness gatherings at a Kingdom Hall since 2012. The first applicant claimed that a man called Fardi noticed a copy of the Bible on the first applicant’s table while he was visiting the applicants’ home.  The first applicant said that Fardi asked the first applicant if he was a Christian.  The first applicant said Fardi then told everyone in the suburb, where the applicants live that the first applicant was a Christian. The first applicant claimed that his father in Lebanon discovered that the first applicant had become a Jehovah’s Witness.  The first applicant claimed that his father cut off financial support to him, disowned him and threatened to kill him.  The first applicant claimed that his wife had been threatened and assaulted on two occasions at shopping centres.  The first applicant also claimed that three sheikhs from his community visited the first applicant at his home, told him to return to the Muslim faith and mentioned the threats and assaults against his wife.  The applicant also claimed that his house and car had been vandalised on numerous occasions. The Tribunal accepted that the assaults on the second applicant may have happened, but considered that they were random attacks.  The Tribunal accepted that the first applicant’s house and car may have been vandalised, but considered that this was not for religious reasons. The Tribunal did not accept that a university lecturer had introduced the first applicant to the Jehovah’s Witness faith.  The Tribunal did not accept that the first applicant’s father had attacked him.  The Tribunal did not accept that a person called Fardi had seen a Bible at the applicants’ home.  (The Tribunal gave reasons for this, including that the accounts given by the first and second applicants were not consistent.) The Tribunal did accept that the first applicant had attended a Kingdom Hall since 2012.  However, the Tribunal considered that the first applicant did so to strengthen his claims to be a refugee.  The Tribunal rejected the first applicant’s reasons for not practicing his alleged religion between 2007 and 2012.  The Tribunal did not accept that the first applicant’s attendance at a Kingdom Hall was known to his relatives or in the broader Lebanese community.  The Tribunal did not accept that the applicants had ever been threatened by relatives, strangers, sheikhs or anyone else for reasons of their real or imputed adherence to the Jehovah’s Witness religion.   The Tribunal considered that if the applicants returned to Lebanon, they would not pursue their alleged religion as Jehovah’s Witnesses because the sole purpose of their participation in those activities in Australia was to obtain protection.  Consequently, the Tribunal did not accept that the applicants would be accused of apostasy if they returned to Lebanon.   The Tribunal also considered the complementary protection provisions.  As the Tribunal did not accept that the applicants were genuine Jehovah’s Witnesses, the Tribunal did not accept that there were substantial grounds for believing that they would suffer significant harm for reasons associated with their supposed involvement in that religion. Nor did the Tribunal accept that the applicants faced significant harm as Sunni Muslims.  The application to this court contained one ground, which was that the Tribunal’s decision was made without jurisdiction and was affected by jurisdictional error.  Five particulars were given of that ground.   The first particular was that the Tribunal had no evidence to base its conclusion that the applicant started his religious activities with the Jehovah’s Witnesses in order to strengthen his claims to be a refugee.  However, there was evidence to support that conclusion.  That evidence was, firstly, that the first applicant did not provide any evidence of having been baptised as a Jehovah’s Witness.  Also, the first applicant came to Australia on a student visa in 2007 and did not participate in Jehovah’s Witness activities until 2012, when he lodged his protection visa application.  These matters were evidence which supported the Tribunal’s conclusion that the applicant had started his Jehovah’s Witness religious activities in Australia in order to strengthen his claims to be a refugee.   The next particular in the application is that the Tribunal had fallen into error by disregarding the first applicant’s religious activities pursuant to s.91R(3) of the Migration Act 1958 (“the Act”).  Subsection 91R(3) of the Act provides as follows:     For the purposes of the application of this Act and the regulations to a particular person:  (a) in determining whether the person has a wellfounded fear of being persecuted for one or more of the reasons mentioned in Article 1A(2) of the Refugees Convention as amended by the Refugees Protocol;   disregard any conduct engaged in by the person in Australia unless:   (b)  the person satisfies the Minister that the person engaged in the conduct otherwise than for the purpose of strengthening the person’s claim to be a refugee within the meaning of the Refugees Convention as amended by the Refugees Protocol.  Under s.91R(3) of the Act, the Tribunal was required to disregard any conduct engaged in by the applicants in Australia unless the applicants satisfied the Minister that they engaged in the conduct otherwise than for the purpose of strengthening their claims to be refugees.  The applicants did not so satisfy the Tribunal. Therefore the Tribunal was obliged to disregard the applicants’ conduct as Jehovah’s Witnesses in Australia.   The next particular in the application was that there was no evidence to suggest that the first applicant and his wife would not engage in Jehovah’s Witness activities on their return to Lebanon.  As the Tribunal had found that the applicants had engaged in Jehovah’s Witness activities in Australia for the sole purpose of obtaining protection, it was open to the Tribunal to conclude that the applicants would not participate in Jehovah’s Witness activities on their return to Lebanon.   The next particular provided in the application was that:   There is a real risk that the first applicant and his wife will suffer persecution from family and in-laws in Lebanon and be accused of apostasy or conversion on their return to Lebanon.  The Tribunal should have taken into account the question of apostasy in Lebanon and the likely effects on the [first] applicant and his wife.   The Tribunal did take into account the question of apostasy.  At paragraph 91 of its reasons for decisions, the Tribunal said the following:   91. The Tribunal finds that if the applicants were to return to Lebanon, they would not engage in any Jehovah’s Witness activities as the sole purpose of their activities in Australia is to obtain protection. Consequently, the Tribunal considers that the applicants would not be accused of apostasy or conversion away from Islam.  Consequently, there is no substance in that ground.    The next particular set out in the application is that:   The Tribunal has erred, in that it comes to the conclusion that there are not substantial grounds for believing there was a real risk the applicants would be subjected to significant harm because of their religion conversion and the fact they are former Sunni Muslims.  Also, substantial grounds include the current political/religious situation in Lebanon and the manner in which apostasy/conversion is treated by the general Muslim population in Lebanon.    The Tribunal did consider the current political and religious situations in Lebanon. At paragraphs 94 to 102 of its reasons for decision, the Tribunal said the following:   94. He referred to the current ‘turmoil’ in Lebanon. He talked about what he saw as rising sectarian tensions and ‘orchestrated targeting’ of various religious groups, including of Sunni Muslims. The applicants, he submitted, would be at risk of harm because of the perception that they are Sunni. He stated there was ‘an underlying perception that they are Sunnis’, especially as they would not dare to disclose their (genuine) Jehovah’s Witness religion.  95. The Tribunal asked the applicants whether they feared harm as Sunnis. The applicants said that they were Jehovah’s Witnesses. They lived in a Sunni area and their (Sunni) relatives thought that if they killed one of the applicants they (the relatives) would go to heaven.  96. The Tribunal said that according to the available country information the risk of harm to a Sunni from Akkar district was only remote. The first named applicant said once again that he feared death because he is a Jehovah’s Witness. When the Tribunal explained one more time the alternative submission, both applicants said they had nothing to add and their fear was because they were Jehovah’s Witnesses. Then, finally, the first named applicant said either as a Jehovah’s Witness or as a Sunni he was at risk.  97. The applicants’ representative said there was a real chance or real likelihood of violence anywhere in Lebanon. The Tribunal said there had been bombings in Tripoli and Beirut but not in Akkar district. The Tribunal said it could not accept on the available information that a Sunni living anywhere in Lebanon faces a real chance of persecution. The representative then pointed out that the Tribunal needs to consider also whether the applicant may be confined to Akkar district of Lebanon.  98. While the focus of the applicant’s claims was their alleged Jehovah’s Witness religion the Tribunal has also considered the applicants’ claims that they fear harm in Lebanon for reasons of their Sunni religion and actual or imputed political opinion in support of Sunni dominated parties.   99. First, the Tribunal notes that the claim was made very late and by their agent, not by the applicants themselves. It was only after the Tribunal explained to the applicants three times what their representative was suggesting that the first named applicant agreed he could be harmed because of his Sunni religion. The Tribunal finds that the applicants do not have a subjective fear of persecution for reasons of their actual or imputed Sunni religion or their actual or imputed political opinion in support of Sunni dominated parties in Lebanon.   100. Furthermore, the country information indicates that despite concerns about a spill over of the violence from Syria, and despite isolated incidents across the country, the vast majority of Sunnis in Lebanon have not become the victims of violence caused by Shias, Hezbollah, Alawites, Syrian agents or anyone else in Lebanon who might be considered to be anti-Sunni. Hezbollah appears focused on supporting President Assad’s operations in Syria and reluctant to provoke conflict within Lebanon. According to a November 2012 International Crisis Group report both sides of Lebanon’s political divide have shown ‘considerable restraint’.  101. The Tribunal has also taken into account information about further acts of violence since the Tribunal held its hearing – 2 major terrorist attacks in Beirut on 19 November 2013 against the Iranian embassy that killed at least 23 people and on 2 January 2014 near a Hezbollah security zone; the twin mosque bombings in Tripoli that killed at least 47 people and other more minor incidents.  102. Based on all the evidence available to it, the Tribunal does not accept that the applicants face a real chance of serious harm amounting to persecution. Having assessed their claims both individually and cumulatively, the Tribunal finds that they do not have a well-founded fear of persecution at the hands of Hezbollah, Shia Muslims, Alawites, Syrian agents or anybody else for reasons of their actual or imputed Sunni religion or actual or imputed political opinion if they were to return to Lebanon now or in the reasonably foreseeable future. The Tribunal considered these issues in detail and referred to relevant country information.  However, the Tribunal concluded that the applicants did not face a real risk of persecution for those reasons and did not face a real risk of significant harm for such reasons.  It seems to me that the Tribunal’s conclusions in this regard were open on the evidence.   The applicants also filed written submissions.  The written submissions largely restate the grounds of application and make submissions going to the merits of the Tribunal’s decision.   The first applicant made oral submissions to the court today.  However, those submissions went to the merits of the Tribunal’s decision.  As explained during the course of the hearing, the court is not able to reconsider the merits of the case.   I am not persuaded that there was any jurisdictional error in the Tribunal’s reasons for decision or in its decision making process.  Consequently, the application will be dismissed.I certify that the preceding twenty-four (24) paragraphs are a true copy of the reasons for judgment of Judge RileyAssociate:  Date: 2 September 2015       ',\n",
       " 'MZAFQ v Minister for Immigration & Anor [2015] FCCA 1899 (24 September 2015)': \"  This is an application for judicial review of a decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal (“the Tribunal”) made 12 May 2014 affirming a decision of the Minister’s Delegate not to grant the applicant a Protection visa (“the visa”). There are three matters of complaint raised and argued on the amended application filed 12 December 2014:i. That the Tribunal failed to evaluate an integer of the applicant’s claim namely that he was at risk of serious or significant harm if he returned to Sri Lanka because he is a Muslim; ii. That the Tribunal recited or gave a summary of the relevant law at the end of its reasons excluding reference to the law in respect of credibility which was a decisive issue in this determination; and iii. That the Tribunal took into account irrelevant considerations about the applicant’s interactions with UNHCR and the way that his wealth would be perceived on return to Sri Lanka.  Both the applicant and the first respondent are represented by Counsel who have provided helpful written submissions. Background  The applicant is from Sri Lanka. He was raised a Muslim. He and his brother worked in his father’s shop in Colombo. His father died in 1996 and the applicant and his brother took over management of the shop. The applicant says that his brother was politically supportive of and involved in the UNP party in Sri Lanka. The applicant says that in 2008 the Sri Lankan police (CID) attended at and searched the shop. He says that the police claim to have found weapons at the shop and that the brother was taken for questioning and has not been seen since. The applicant says that the police officers also sought his attendance for interview. He says that he later attended at two police stations to enquire about his brother and at the second police station was accused of involvement in terrorist activities and with the LTTE. He says that he was threatened with arrest and went into hiding in Sri Lanka. The applicant says that his mother reported to him that armed men came to her home advising her that the brother was in custody and would not be released until the applicant himself reported to police. The applicant says that his mother reported the officers threatening to shoot the applicant. The applicant says that a friend told him that he was on a “wanted list” and advised him to leave the country. On 14 July 2009 the applicant travelled from Sri Lanka to Singapore from Colombo airport. In October 2009 the applicant went to Malaysia and boarded a boat to Australia. That boat was intercepted by Indonesian authorities. The applicant and other passengers refused to disembark. Media reports identified passengers as “LTTE suspects”. The applicant eventually disembarked and remained in Indonesia for two years. He says he boarded another boat for Australia arriving on 12 February 2012.  The applicant lodged his application for a Protection visa on 14 June 2012. The Minister’s Delegate refused the applicant’s application on 22 October 2012. He made an application to the Tribunal for a review on 31 October 2012. The Tribunal held its hearing on 4 March 2013. The Tribunal’s decision was not handed down for some 14 months being on 12 May 2014.  The Tribunal in its reasons made a number of findings of fact and credit including:i. That the applicant is of Muslim religion, speaks Tamil and that his surname is readily identifiable as a Muslim name within Sri Lankan culture [15]; ii. That the applicant would not be imputed with Tamil ethnicity in Sri Lanka or with pro-LTTE opinions or connections [15]; iii. That the applicant and his brother and late father have not been involved in activities or support of LTTE [16]; iv. That the applicant, his brother and late father operated an electrical compliances shop in Colombo but the Tribunal did not find that “an audit turned up information which bred suspicion of weapons trading or that weapons were discovered at the shop in 2008” [20]; v. The Tribunal did not accept the applicant’s overall account of his or his brother’s circumstances in Sri Lanka [21]; vi. The Tribunal found it implausible that the police did not formally question, detain or arrest the applicant on his two visits to the police station after his brother’s alleged detention and disappearance and/or that he was able to leave Sri Lanka on his own passport from Colombo airport if he was wanted by the police as alleged [23]; vii. The Tribunal did not accept that the applicant’s brother was detained or went missing in 2008; viii. The Tribunal did not accept that the applicant or his brother are UNP supporters or that they have faced past serious harm from actual or imputed UNP opinions [28]; ix. The Tribunal did not accept that the applicant or his brother had ever been imputed with LTTE connections [30]. Ground 1- the Refugee Review Tribunal failed to consider an integer of the applicant’s claim for protection, namely that there was a real chance that he would be subject to serious or significant harm by reason of being a Muslim in Sri Lanka.  Counsel for the applicant says that the claim was made but not considered or engaged by the Tribunal. At [11] of its reasons the Tribunal states:The core issue is whether the applicant needs protection from harm (as defined in Australian law) in Sri Lanka for any reason advanced by him regarding his actual or imputed pro-LTTE or pro-UNP political opinion, (imputed) Tamil ethnicity, and/or his Muslim religion...  At [4] of its reasons the Tribunal states:The applicant’s core protection claims regard risks of arbitrary detention, imprisonment, harassment and mistreatment, abduction/arbitrary disappearance, torture or death due to any/each/ all of the following:  ... His Muslim religion, which – taken with his (and his family’s) position as wealthy business-owners – gives rise to risks of harm, including in the form of extortion or death...  At [5] the Tribunal notes in respect of the applicant “...He identifies as being of Tamil ethnicity and Muslim religion.”. At [15] the Tribunal says “I accept the applicant’s account that he is of Muslim religion...”. The applicant says that his representative’s written submissions and post-hearing submissions of 22 March 2013 noted the threat of harm to the applicant as a Muslim in Sri Lanka. Counsel for the applicant says that the Tribunal’s reasons disclose no particular consideration of the integer (as accepted by the Tribunal) of risk of harm solely because of his Muslim religion.  At [45] the Tribunal says:The applicant’s claims regarding his religion are contained to the matters above. Nothing in the claims, evidence, and arguments and/or the material provided supports a finding that the applicant will face serious harm in his usual area of residence or work now or in the reasonably foreseeable future due to his religion.  Despite the above, the applicant says that such a conclusion or finding does not follow from any obvious engagement or consideration of the integer of fear of harm due to his Muslim religion. It is clear at [42] of the reasons that the Tribunal considered an integer of “risks to wealthy Muslim business-owners in Colombo”. However, the applicant argues the practice of his religion per se is a separate integer and one not engaged by the Tribunal. Counsel for the first respondent argues in respect of Ground 1 on two bases. Firstly, whilst Counsel does not take issue with the applicant posing the “argument” that he is a Muslim, he says that there must be more than a “clearly articulated argument” in that there must be “established facts” supporting the argument. Put simply, the Minister says that the applicant does not establish a factual nexus of either serious harm (s.91R of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) (“the Act”)) or significant harm (s.36(2A) of the Act). Counsel says that whilst the applicant identified himself as a Muslim, there was no claim made or evidence put forward that he faced a real chance of experiencing serious harm or significant harm if returned to Sri Lanka on account of him being a Muslim. Secondly, and in the alternative, Counsel for the Minister argues that the Tribunal did, in fact, consider the applicant’s claims based on his religion. Firstly, I consider whether the applicant made a claim of facing a real chance of experiencing serious harm or significant harm if returned to Sri Lanka or, rather, as the first respondent argues, he simply mounted an argument of being Muslim without establishing any fact or nexus of serious or significant harm? Paragraph [45] of the Tribunal’s reasons is relevant. This paragraph is, however, in my view, simply and solely the stated findings or conclusion. It does not represent an engagement or consideration of the integers. Paragraph [45] appears after the heading “Risks to wealthy Muslim business-owners in Colombo”. This, of course, is a separate integer to that of the applicant being a Muslim simpliciter. No other part of the Tribunal’s report is relied upon as addressing or engaging this integer. I am therefore satisfied on a reading of the Tribunal’s reasons that it did not consider an integer being the applicant’s Muslim religion. This, however, is not the argument before me. Rather the first respondent says no claim is made out as to fear of harm in respect of this factor. On 9 May 2012 the applicant completed an Irregular Maritime Entry and Arrival Interview. At page 16 (CB 21) the applicant was asked “Are you a member of any particular social or religious group?”. He answered “Yes” and then detailed:I was a member of young boys Muslim Association. When? I don’t remember. How many years a member? 1-2 years. What was the association called? Muslim Young Boys Association.  When asked as to his level of involvement with that group the applicant responded:I had a big problem with one of the gangs involving one of the mosques. When was this? 2007. Briefly tell me what happened? In the holy month of Ramadan, MAULVI of the local mosque (religious head) was assaulted by a Singhalese gang while on his way to the mosque. The situation escalated into riots between the Singhalese majority community and the Muslims. What was your involvement? I was a member of the committee that ran the Mosque I headed a group of Muslims and led them to the police station and complained. My name appears on the written complaint to the police. When justice was not delivered we went to the local Buddhist mosque who was the head of the Singhalese majority community to seek justice and to make reconciliation but it was turned down and they told us that if we escalated the issue the mosque would simply disappear. Being a member of the minority group I lost faith in the system.  This was an early interview for the applicant. He says that he was active in the Muslim community and involved in troubles and confrontations with the Singhalese majority. In the applicant’s own statement of 14 June 2012 (CB 54) he says at [2-3]:[2] I am Tamil and Muslim. [3] I fear that if I was forced to return to Sri Lanka I would be at risk of being harmed because of my race and religion...  The Court Book provided to me at page 164 shows the Delegate’s reasons noting:The applicant claims that he fears return to Sri Lanka due to his race as a Tamil, his religion being a Muslim... The agent also made a verbal statement. In summary the agent stated that:  The applicant has a well-founded fear of persecution as a Tamil and a Muslim. The Delegate’s decision (CB 168-172) recognises the applicant’s claim and deals with it at (CB 172), thus:I have considered the applicant’s claims on the basis of being a Muslim, and even considered country information that states in the early 1990’s the Muslims from the North and the east suffered at the hand of the Tamils. “For about 21 years, more than 100,000 Internally Displaced People from the Northern Province of Sri Lanka have been languishing in camps. Mainly from the Muslim Community, these people were forced out by the LTTE for crimes of not being Tamil.” This again supports the fact that Muslims were perceived as a separate ethnic group despite speaking the Tamil language. I accept that there have been attacks on Muslim shrines as well as other religious holy places in Sri Lanka. “Beginning in 2010, Muslim and Hindu sites have also been targeted. On September 14, 2011, More than 100 monks led a crowd to destroy a Muslim shrine in Ampara district because, according to one of the monks, it was on land given to the Singhalese Buddhists 2,000 years earlier.”  I read the Delegate, therefore, as accepting the articulation of the applicant’s claim and dealing with it. On 22 March 2013 the applicant, through the Refugee Advice and Casework Service (RACS), made a lengthy post-hearing submission on his behalf shown at Court Book 209. On page 1 of the submissions there appears a clear distinction between the applicant’s claim as a Muslim and his claimed integer as a Muslim business owner. That distinction is repeated on page 2 of the submissions at CB 210 as:It is further submitted that in light of recent country reports, (the applicant) is at risk of harm as a Muslim which is heightened by his occupation as a businessman.  At CB 217 under point 5 being the heading  “(The applicant’s) fears as a Muslim” the submissions state:We note that (the applicant’s) fear of harm as a Muslim in Sri Lanka was raised at the DIAC level. Since the DIAC Decision, (the applicant’s) risk of harm as a Muslim has increased due to recent reports of an upsurge in anti-Muslim sentiment and attacks in Sri Lanka. In light of those reports, it is submitted that there is a real chance that (the applicant) will suffer serious harm on the basis of his Muslim religion under section 91R(2) of the Act if he was forced to return to Sri Lanka. It is submitted that (the applicant) is particularly at risk as a Muslim for the following reasons:  He is religious and frequents religious cites (sic), participates in religious festivals and is involved in the Muslim community in Sri Lanka; He has instructed is that he would openly speak out against anti-Muslim attacks in Sri Lanka thereby exposing himself to risk; and He is a visible target as a Muslim business owner from a family of financial means whose family members have been previously targeted. There then appears in the submissions a heading at CB 218 being “Violence against Muslims”. The submissions introduce country information from the International Crisis Group in a report titled “Sri Lanka’s Authoritarian Turn: The Need for International Action” of 20 February 2013. There is a reference to an upsurge of attacks by militant Buddhists on Muslim religious sites and businesses. There is reference to a radical Buddhist group lead by monks having attacked and damaged mosques. There is reference to Muslim businesses in the Colombo area having being targeted for closure in violent public protests. Specifically, there is reference to a notice having been sent to all households in a Muslim village in Kurunegala district stating “...the pariah Muslim who steals the wealth of the majority Sinhalese”... “you will be dead within the month of March 2013.” There is reference to threats against Muslims intensifying and turning violent and of people getting “beaten up”. The country information includes a BBC report of 17 February 2013 reporting:A large rally lead by a new hard line Sinhalese Borders Group in Sri Lanka which target Muslims calling for the abolition of the Muslim halal system of certifying foods and other goods.  That information cites :The protests against Muslim shops and the halal system represents a deeper anti-Muslim undercurrent that has resulted in threats and attack against Muslims in Sri Lanka.  At CB 219  the submission continues under the heading “Lack of state protection for Muslims” and states:Despite some public statements by the Sri Lankan government condemning the anti-Muslim violence, reports indicate that the government has been unwilling to protect Muslims against the rising tide of anti-Muslim sentiment and violence. The ICG reported that “[t]o date, the government has done little to prevent the attacks” and “little to discourage” the anti-Muslim violence by nationalist Buddhist groups. The BBC article dated 17 January 2013 also pointed to the unwillingness of the government to stop the anti-Muslim violence... Further, the absence of adequate protection for Muslims should be viewed in context of the poor human rights track record of the Sri Lankan authorities, particularly in relation to ethnic minorities.  It is clear from its reasons that the Tribunal noted the applicant’s claim based on the integer of religion. Paragraph [11] satisfies me that the Tribunal recognised the applicant’s claim of fear of harm by reason of being a Muslim as a separate integer. Further, at [9] and when referencing the Delegate’s decision the Tribunal notes “She found the applicant would not face persecution or significant harm by reason of his religion.” Paragraph [45] of the Tribunal’s reasons also recognise the applicant’s argument based on his religion. I am satisfied that the post-hearing submission alone provides the nexus or established fact that the first respondent says is missing in that it provides a claim of fear of severe or significant harm by reason of religion being an established convention reason. The claim is evidenced by Country information included in the submission.  I agree that paragraph [45] of the Tribunal’s reasons is perfunctory in its conclusions that “The applicant’s claims regarding his religion are contained to the matters above.” There is no engagement of the post-hearing material evident in the Tribunal’s reasons. Whilst the separate integer of “risks to wealthy Muslim business owners in Colombo” is addressed, the integer of “fear by reason of being a Muslim in Sri Lanka” is not addressed or engaged. In Htun v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs[1] the Full Court stated:The requirement to review the decision under s 414 of the Act requires the tribunal to consider the claims of the applicant. To make a decision without having considered all the claims is to fail to complete the exercise of jurisdiction embarked on. The claim or claims and its or their component integers are considerations made mandatorily relevant by the Act for consideration in the sense discussed in Minister for Aboriginal Affairs v Peko-Wallsend [1986] HCA 40;  (1986) 162 CLR 24 ;  66 ALR 299 and Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Yusuf [2001] HCA 30;  (2001) 206 CLR 323 ;  180 ALR 1 ;  62 ALD 225. See also Sellamuthu v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [1999] FCA 247;  (1999) 90 FCR 287 ;  58 ALD 30 at  [18], [19], [21] and [50]. It is to be distinguished from errant fact finding. The nature and extent of the task of the tribunal revealed by the terms of the Act, for example ss 54, 57, 65, 414, 415, 423, 424, 425, 427 and 428 and the express reference in reg 866 to the “claims” of the applicant for example 866.211, make it clear that the tribunal's statutorily required task is to examine and deal with the claims for asylum made by the applicant.   In summary, therefore, I am satisfied that the applicant raised a particular integer of claim of fear of harm by reason of his Muslim religion. I reject the Minister’s argument that no established fact or nexus of fear of severe or substantial harm was made. I reject the Minister’s alternative argument that the Tribunal did, in fact, engage and evaluate the applicant’s claim evidenced by paragraph [45] of its reasons. As such, failure to engage and evaluate an integer of an applicant’s claim causes the Tribunal’s decision to be infected by jurisdictional error and the Applicant should be granted the relief sought. Ground 2- the Refugee Review Tribunal erred by failing to have regard to: a. Australian case law relevant to the assessment of the applicant’s claims for protection, especially in respect of how the credibility of the protection claim should be assessed according to law;b. Alternatively, considered some case law (other than credibility case law, which was not considered at all) as a mere after thought or formality.  Although the applicant succeeds on Ground 1 and obtains the relief sought, I still turn to consider Grounds 2 and 3. The applicant’s argument here focuses on the credibility assessment of the applicant by the Tribunal and he argues that the Tribunal misapplied the law (or failed to apply the law) in respect of credibility assessment claimants for protection visas.  Firstly the applicant argues that the Tribunal in its reasons does not recite or apply case law on credibility at all. Essentially the applicant focuses on paragraph [22] of the Tribunal’s reasons and argues that the credibility finding does not necessarily flow from the facts. The factual basis is the applicant’s evidence in respect of transporting goods from Colombo to Jaffna. The Tribunal’s reasons at paragraph [22] state:The applicant said at the hearing that the shop’s activities were of concern to police due to its regular deliveries of electronics outside of Colombo, to LTTE areas, including for instance, Jaffna. The applicant said he was not aware of any problems arising from these practices before 2008 (he speculated there was a possibility of minor problems which his father and brother may not have told him about). I find this speculative and am not willing to accept it, given the core credibility findings on this overall matter (my emphasis). I found the applicant’s account at the hearing of the business’’ trade to Jaffna, Vavuniya and other areas of the north/east to be variable, internally incoherent or contradictory, and therefore unreliable. He seemed to say at the hearing that he was personally involved in deliveries to Jaffna, then that others but not him did the deliveries, then that customers ordered from the business and collected goods to transport to places like Jaffna in the north.  Counsel for the applicant says that a reading of the transcript sees the applicant offering a coherent explanation for his role of how deliveries to Jaffna were sometimes made by him and sometimes by others. Yet, it is argued, this one finding of credit permeates the remainder of the issues for determination at the hearing before the Tribunal and that this represents a misapplication of the law where a Tribunal should be sensitive to the difficulties faced by asylum seekers in mounting cases before a Tribunal and a careful approach should therefore be adopted.[2] The applicant says that this legal principle is neither stated nor adopted. The difficulty with this argument is, however, one of context. The Tribunal’s comments as to credibility and the “overall matter” should be read together with paragraph [23] of its reasons which constitute findings of credit as follows:As I foreshadowed at the hearing, I find it implausible:  that police did not ever formally question, detain or arrest the applicant on either of the two occasions he purportedly attended police stations enquiring of his brother after late 2008, particularly given the gravity of allegations that he was involved in holding or shipping arms and/or electronics to the LTTE in Tamil areas, during a period of civil war where LTTE actions were a core national security concern to the Sri Lankan government; that on both occasions he attended the stations, police contacted superiors and as a result had detailed knowledge of the allegations the applicant, and continued to assert those allegations, yet allowed him to casually leave the station; that- notwithstanding the possibility of general practices of corruption and bribery by officials in Sri Lanka – the applicant would be allowed by government officials to leave the country on a passport in his own name in 2009 (when intensive post-conflict efforts at identification, containment and re-education of LTTE combatants occurred) if he was wanted by police as an alleged LTTE supplier during a civil war period; that the police would persist from 2008 to now with varying degrees of intensity- in making enquiries of the applicant at his mother’s house and demanding he report to police – given his account the police allowed the applicant to leave freely twice from police stations, in circumstances where they had detailed knowledge of the allegations against the applicant.  A reading of the transcript of the hearing before the Tribunal[3] does, in my view, leave it open to the Tribunal to make the findings that it previously did on the basis of “variable, internally incoherent or contradictory, and therefore unreliable” evidence. It does not follow then that there was any overzealous, overly cautious or sceptical assessment of the applicant’s credibility, or, therefore, a misapplication of the accepted law as to credibility. Alternatively, the applicant argues that the setting out of the Tribunal’s reasons with the statement of legal principles being at the end of those reasons following a gap between paragraphs [51] and [52] is demonstrative of the Tribunal’s haste under pressure to hand down its reasons (also evidenced by the 14 month delay in doing so) and an exercise of simple “cutting and pasting” with no engagement with the relevant law as to credibility where the determination itself is based largely on negative findings of the applicant’s credibility. The importance of an understandable and observable process of reasoning by the author of the reasons was noted by the Full Court in SZNZK v Minister for Immigration & Citizenship[4] where their Honours observed:Ordinarily, it might be possible to determine from the balance of the reasons of a delegate what the actual process of reasoning was and, more importantly, whether the insertion of the incorrect statement was merely an editorial error – perhaps an errant cut and paste – rather than something going to the root of the reasoning process.  However, unfortunately this is not possible.  Apart from very generalised statements about his disbelief of the appellant there is little in the way of forensic substance to the balance of the delegate’s reasons.   The impression that there has been carried out a mechanical process of cutting and pasting devoid of cognitive activity is not in any way dispelled by observing that at least two paragraphs of the reasons have clearly been copied from each other (cf. under the heading “Reasons” and the heading “Fear of Hindu and Muslin Extremists”).  Further in Wright Rubber products Pty Ltd v Bayer A G[5] the Court stated:Delay can have insidious consequences. A Full Court discussed the consequences of delay in giving judgment in Expectation Pty Ltd v PRD Realty Pty Ltd [2004] FCAFC 189;  (2004) 140 FCR 17. While many of the observations made by the Full Court concerned the consequences of a delayed judgment after a final hearing involving contested evidence, the following observations (at [74]) are apt to apply more generally and to delayed judgments in relation to interlocutory contests: ... A judge who comes to make an inordinately delayed decision will inevitably be subjected to great pressure to complete and publish the judgment. A conscientious judge could not but feel that pressure. It is almost inevitable that there will also be some form of external pressure – whether from the parties, the management of the Court, the press or parliamentarians. That pressure could well unconsciously affect the process of decision-making and the process of giving reasons for decision. The decision that is easiest to make and express will have great psychological attraction. As was recently said by the Western Australian Court of Appeal in Mount Lawley Pty Ltd v Western Australian Planning Commission  [2004] WASCA 149, in the course of a valuable review of the significance of delay in the delivery of judgments:\\\\ ‘...a long delay can give rise to disquiet ... because of the suspicion, on the part of the losing party, that the task may have become too much for the trial Judge and that he or she had been unable, in the end, to grapple adequately with the issues.’ ([31]).  I am satisfied however that questions flowing from the fourteen month delay in the Tribunal handing down its determination are addressed by the Tribunal itself in its own reasons at paragraph [10] where the member says:The applicant’s evidence and representative’s submissions during the review are considered below. Given the regrettable delay between the hearing and this decision, I reviewed the entire hearing audio-recording in the weeks prior to finalising the decision. My findings are based on matters raised or foreshadowed at the hearing and I have had regard both to the applicant’s responses to those matters at the hearing and to the representative’s post-hearting written submissions, which were made after I gave her time to obtain and consider the hearing audio-recording (given her attendance by telephone).  Therefore, whilst noting the obvious concerns of superior Courts in looking into the delays of judgment of a finder of fact and credit, no specific error or omission here is pointed to. Rather, the Court is asked to make general inferences flowing from the delay. The Tribunal member, however, says that she has fully informed herself contemporaneously with the writing of the reasons. On my reading of the reasons and the Tribunal’s findings, any findings of credit relate to particulars of fact rather than generalisation of credit of the individual and best evidenced at paragraph [23] of the reasons.  It is true that paragraph [53] of the reasons represents a generalised statement of the relevant law and so as to inform the basis of the reasons themselves. The applicant points to this as an exercise of “cutting and pasting”. This may well be the case but it does not necessarily follow that an error in the application of the legal principles flows. No such particularised error is alleged. Nothing in the Tribunal’s reasons reveals a misunderstanding of the law and none is alleged. It follows that I find no merit in ground two of the application. Ground 3 – The Refugee Review Tribunal erred by taking into account an irrelevant consideration, namely:   whether the Applicant ‘approach[ed] UNHCR in Malaysia’ or was ‘registered, processed or assessed by UNHCR... in Indonesia’ and/or  that the Applicant would not be ‘perceived as a wealthy Tamil Muslim businessman on return’ because he ‘has not been in Sri Lanka for around four years’. Ground 3(b) is abandoned. The applicant therefore argues that the Tribunal erred in taking into account an irrelevant consideration namely the applicant’s claim in approaching UNHCR in Malaysia and/or was registered, processed or assessed by UNHCR in Indonesia. The Tribunal’s reasons at paragraph [34] state:Even giving the benefit of the doubt that the applicant did not approach UNHCR in Malaysia because he had no appreciation of its processes, I do not accept uncritically (given the credibility findings elsewhere) his assertion that he did register with UNHCR in Indonesia in the two-year period there between the time he says he swam to Indonesia shores after months on the Merak boat (stationed at the port) and departed Indonesia in 2012. Based on the material before me, I do not accept the applicant was ever registered, processed or assessed by UNHCR as a refugee in Indonesia between late 2009 and early 2012.  Counsel for the applicant refers me to and relies on the judgment of Mason J in Minister for Aboriginal Affairs v Peko-Wallsend Ltd[6] at paragraph [15] saying that it is the terms of s.36 of the Act which defines and limits the considerations here and specifically that the only country which is relevant to the determination is the country in respect to which the applicant for a visa would be returned and it follows that any consideration of any other country and the considerations engaged in by the Tribunal are irrelevant.  Counsel refers me to a decision of the Full Court of the Federal Court in Minister for Immigration and Border Protection v MZYTS[7] at paragraph [49] as follows:The Court is entitled to take the reasons of the Tribunal as setting out the findings of fact the Tribunal itself considered material to its decision, and as reciting the evidence and other material which the Tribunal itself considered relevant to the findings it made: Representing as it does what the Tribunal itself considered important and material, what is present — and what is absent — from the reasons may in a given case enable a Court on review to find jurisdictional error.  Counsel for the applicant argues that it is open to find here that the Tribunal’s evaluation and credit findings in respect of the applicant’s alleged dealings with UNHCR in Malaysia and Indonesia was material to the Tribunal’s ultimate decision making process but an irrelevant consideration to that process and therefore leading to jurisdictional error. I do not accept the applicant’s argument. I am of the view that the Tribunal is simply responding at paragraph [34] to a factual platform and claim made by the applicant. I do not read that paragraph as moving on to attribute weight to a credit finding. In any event, no statutory prohibition is identified and it behoves the Tribunal to address an applicant’s claim but crucially here no attributing of weight flows. I find no merit in this ground. Conclusion.   Given my findings as to merit in ground one of the application, the applicant will be afforded the relief sought and the matter remitted to the Tribunal for hearing. I certify that the preceding fifty-eight (58) paragraphs are a true copy of the reasons for judgment of Judge McGuireDate: 24 September 2015 [1] (2001) 194 ALR 244 at [42][2] Guo v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (1996) 40ALD 445 at [482][3] See affidavit of Claire Louise Toner sworn 12 December 2014 at p.6.[4] [2010] FCA 651 at  [38][5] [2010] FCAFC 85 at  [43][6] [1986] HCA 40[7] [2013] FCAFC 114       \",\n",
       " 'MZAGB v Minister for Immigration & Anor [2015] FCCA 2772 (27 August 2015)': ' (Revised from transcript)  In this matter the applicant, by his solicitor, applies for an adjournment of the proceeding.  His solicitor, Mr Gordon, has told the court, and I entirely accept, that he first saw the applicant at 4:00pm yesterday.  He was provided with the Court Book (“CB”), and possibly some other materials.  He has not had the time he would require to form any view as to precisely what amended application he might seek to file, and he seeks time to form such an opinion.   Counsel for the First Respondent opposes the adjournment.  He submits, correctly enough, that the proposed amended grounds of application are not indicated, although I repeat, no criticism redounds to Mr Gordon as to that.  Counsel pointed out that the applicant did not attend either the delegate or the Tribunal hearings, although he appeared at the directions hearing that set this matter down for hearing today.   The reasons that I am going to give now will explain both why I will not grant the adjournment, and why I will dismiss the application.  I should note that Mr Brown submitted, correctly enough, that if the adjournment was not granted, the application was likely to be dismissed. The applicant was, in fact, in the community when he was arrested on a drink-driving charge, and records relating to that are in the early part of the Court Book.  As a result of that arrest he was interviewed by a Departmental officer, and I note that, at CB6, he was asked – and this question, no doubt, sprang from the fact that he had entered Australia on a student visa:  “Did you ever go to school here?    No, I did not.  Did you ever intend to study here?   No, I did not.    I want to confirm to you, did you say you never intended to study here?    Yes my wife did though but I did not see her for six months after I came here.” At CB7 he was asked:  “Are there any reasons why you cannot return to your home country?”  The answer was:   “No there is no reason, but I am happy over here.  I feel at home here and I don’t want to leave.”At CB10 the Departmental officer wrote:   “I am not satisfied that this person is subject to, or making acceptable arrangements to depart Australia as required by regulation 050.212(2).  Mr Singh stated that he does not want to depart A/a nor is he willing to depart.  Mr Singh stated he would like to remain in Australia and work and study.  Mr Singh has indicated that he would like to lodge a visa to remain here but does not know which visa he wants, and stated any that will allow him to stay.”   At CB27 it is apparent that the applicant’s address since September 2012 has been at 5/15 Logie Street, Oakleigh, Victoria, 3166.  All correspondence relevant to this proceeding has clearly been sent to him at that address, and there is no reason to suppose - bearing in mind that it is, as I understand it, still his address and bearing in mind that it is the address on his application to this court- that he has not received the correspondence he has been sent from time to time.   The applicant did not make arrangements to attend upon the delegate, and I note that at CB97, as part of the delegate’s decision, the delegate referred to the fact that the applicant was interviewed in relation to his bridging visa application on 13 September 2013, and the applicant stated that a friend would organise his return to India.  The delegate said:  “I consider it significant that the applicant stated in the weeks leading up to the lodgement of his Protection visa application that there were no reasons why he could not return to India and that he has now submitted an application containing minimal information.”   On 7 April 2014 the applicant was sent, at his address, an invitation to appear before the Tribunal.  He did not complete the response document, nor did he attend the Tribunal hearing itself.  The Tribunal analysed the applicant’s claims, relevantly at paragraphs 30 and following (CB 137-138), as follows:  “30. The applicant is a Sikh from the Punjab who speaks, reads and writes Punjabi and Hindi.  He has 12 years of education.  He left India to further his study.  He claims he faced attacks many times in India because he is the only son of his parents, and his uncle and cousins want to kill him for his property.  He claims his uncle, who has the police and politicians on his side, gave money to the local mafia to kill him, and will succeed in killing him if he returns.    31. The applicant provides no information as to when the above claimed events occurred, nor, importantly, why, how and when his uncle and relatives became interested in his property.   The Tribunal is unable to appreciate their motives and the strengths of those motives in either seeking his property or seeking to harm him in connexion to their claimed ambitions.  Indeed, he does not give any detail as to what property he claims is in dispute, or is coveted.  In general, his claims are vague and lack any form of convincing detail.  32. For all of the above reasons I do not accept that the applicant has presented a credible set of claims for a protection, and I reject those claims in toto, including that he has been, is or will be involved in a dispute with his relatives, family or other persons over property or another matter, where another party has or will threaten him with, or carry out on him, violence, death, or any other form of serious or significant harm.” The applicant attended a directions hearing before Registrar Caporale on 17 September 2014.  At that time he was given until 23 July 2015 year to file any amended application and written submissions.  He would appear not to have made any endeavour to contact his solicitor until the day before the hearing.  That delay is, of course, not in any way explained.  It would be difficult at this stage to see quite how it might be. The first respondent’s written submissions point out that the applicant arrived in Australia on a class TU subclass 572 (student) visa.  That was in 2009.  Notwithstanding telling a departmental officer in 2013 that there was no reason he had to prevent his returning to India, that he felt happy here and was at home here and did not want to leave, the applicant then filed his protection application on 30 September 2013.  Heerey J, amongst others, has pointed out that a court or a Tribunal is entitled to regard the delay in the application for the Protection visa as a relevant matter.  In the circumstances where the Court Book reveals the matters to which I have referred, it is immediately apparent that it is wholly inappropriate to adjourn the proceeding.  I accept, and repeat again, no criticism whatsoever redounds to the applicant’s solicitor.  But the applicant has delayed until the absolute last moment to seek legal advice. There is nothing in his grounds of application to the court that articulates, let alone sets out in any convincing way, any asserted jurisdictional error on the part of the Tribunal.   The Tribunal’s factual findings in the circumstances where clearly open to it and indeed, the applicant’s claims as articulated do not seem to me to advance any Convention nexus in any event.  In all the circumstances, including the past history of the applicant’s failure to attend relevant proceedings – and I note that despite being told about this one by his solicitor, he has not attended today- and bearing in mind the weakness and one might say inescapable weakness of his case, it is plainly not in the interests of the administration of justice to adjourn.  So I decline to adjourn and I dismiss the application. So I dismiss the adjournment application.  I also dismiss the substantive application.  The applicant is to pay the first respondent’s costs fixed at $6200.I certify that the preceding thirteen (13) paragraphs are a true copy of the reasons for judgment of Judge BurchardtAssociate:  Date:  12 October 2015       ',\n",
       " 'MZAIW v Minister for Immigration & Anor [2015] FCCA 2536 (17 September 2015)': '  By Application filed on 17 July 2014, the Applicant seeks judicial review of a decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal (as it then was) (‘the Tribunal’) made on 30 June 2014.  In that decision, the Tribunal affirmed a decision of a Delegate of the Minister for Immigration & Border Protection (‘the Delegate’) not to grant the Applicant a Protection (Class XA) visa (‘the visa’).  In the grounds of application as set out, no particulars were provided.  The grounds of application were merely:-  “1. The Refugee Review Tribunal did not afford me procedural fairness:  2. The Refugee Review Tribunal applied the wrong legal test.” In oral submissions at the hearing, the Applicant was unable to particularise those matters he complained of. By Response filed on 1 September 2014, the First Respondent sought dismissal of the application on the basis that the Application for judicial review did not establish any jurisdictional error in the decision of the Tribunal. On 5 November 2014, the Court ordered, by consent, amongst other orders, that on or before 4 February 2015, the Applicant file and serve any amended application including any additional grounds of review with complete particulars of each ground and further written submissions prior to the final hearing.  The First Respondent did not comply with either of those orders.  On the final hearing of the matter, there was, otherwise, before the Court the evidence as contained in the Court Book filed by the First Respondent and the First Respondent’s Written Submissions.   History The Applicant was born on 3 March 1992 in Sri Lanka.  He is aged 23 years.  He is a Hindu Tamil.  He arrived in Australia as an unauthorised boat arrival without any identity documents.  The Tribunal was satisfied that he was a Sri Lankan national who resided in Sri Lanka before coming to Australia in May 2012, and that Sri Lanka is his receiving country for the purposes of s.36(2)(aa) of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) (‘the Act’). On 24 August 2012, the First Respondent exercised his power under s.46A(2) of the Act to allow the Applicant to lodge a visa application and, on the same day, the Applicant did so.  That Application was accompanied by a statutory declaration detailing the Applicant’s claims.  The Applicant had earlier participated in an entry interview. On 17 July 2013, the Delegate refused the application for a visa.  On 19 July 2013, the Applicant lodged an Application in the Tribunal seeking review of the Delegate’s decision. On 18 February 2014, the Applicant was invited to attend a hearing of the Tribunal. On 19 March 2014, the Applicant’s agent provided written submissions.  Those submissions attached a statement from the Applicant which claimed he had three other brothers who had successfully claimed asylum in the United Kingdom. On 2 April 2014, the Applicant and his lawyer attended the Tribunal for a hearing. He was assisted by an interpreter in the Tamil and English languages.  At the hearing, the Applicant provided documents demonstrating that one brother had been granted asylum in the United Kingdom and another brother had been granted leave to stay in the United Kingdom indefinitely. On 22 May 2014, the Tribunal invited the Applicant to comment on, or respond to, information which the Tribunal considered would, subject to the Applicant’s comments or response, be the reason or a part of the reason for affirming the decision under review. Essentially, the Applicant was invited to comment on inconsistencies in his evidence between what was said at his entrance interview, and what he later claimed; what he told the Delegate and what he told the Tribunal; and his evidence and that of his brother.  The Applicant was told by the Tribunal the following:-  “This information is relevant to the review because due to your failure to mention being detained in 2011 in your entry interview and the inconstancies (sic) in your account as to what occurred when you were arrested[,] the Tribunal may not accept that you were arrested and detained for2 days in 2011.”[1] On 5 June 2014, the Applicant’s lawyer provided a written response to the invitation to comment and a Statutory Declaration from the Applicant declared at Preston in the State of Victoria on 3 June 2014 was forwarded to the Tribunal.  The response claimed that the Applicant’s answers had been misinterpreted and that had given rise to the inconsistencies with the previous evidence provided by him. On 30 June 2014, the Tribunal affirmed the Delegate’s decision. As succinctly set out in the First Respondent’s Written Submissions at paragraph 14, the Applicant claimed to have a well-founded fear of persecution for the following reasons:-  “His race  14.1 The applicant claimed that he suffered persecution on the basis of his Tamil ethnicity.  This claim overlapped with his claim of persecution on the basis of his imputed political opinion (being perceived as a LTTE supporter) and on the basis of membership of a particular social group (Young Tamil Men).His imputed political opinion (as a consequence of his father’s profile with the LTTE, being a member of a family with four brothers outside of Sri Lanka and his act of seeking asylum) 14.2 The applicant claimed that his father - a fisherman - disappeared in 1991 and never came back.  His mother told the applicant he had died in the war and his father was perceived to have been a member of the LTTE.  As a consequence of his father’s suspected involvement in the LTTE, the applicant claims to fear persecution from the Sri Lankan authorities on the basis of his imputed support for the LTTE.   14.3 The applicant claimed that in 2011, the Sri Lankan authorities came looking for him and his brother.  14.4 The applicant claims that as he has four brothers, all of whom have fled Sri Lanka to seek protection overseas, he fears persecution on the basis that he will be perceived to be opposed to the Sri Lankan government.  His membership of a particular social group (Young Tamil men who are suspected of associating with or supporting the LTTE and being a failed asylum seeker)  14.5 The applicant did not expressly rely on his Hindu faith as a basis for claiming protection but claimed that in February or March 2011, he and his friends held a religious ceremony and were arrested by army officers and detained in a nearby army camp.  They were detained for two days and tortured, beaten and had guns put to their heads.  14.6 The applicant claimed that he was harassed, rounded-up and humiliated by authorities on a daily basis on the way to school.  14.7 The applicant also claims to have suffered discrimination as a sportsman.  In 2010, after being selected to compete in a provincial running competition he was picked up and taken to a police station and beaten.  After being released he managed to compete but was disqualified for no reason after coming first.  In 2011, the authorities refused to select him for a national competition after he came second in another running competition.  14.8 The applicant claimed that he would be persecuted if he was to be returned to Sri Lanka due to his Tamil ethnicity and his act of seeking asylum.”[2] Consideration   The Tribunal provided a comprehensive and well-reasoned decision.  As to the Applicant’s assertion that the Tribunal applied the wrong legal test, there is no merit to that ground.  The Tribunal was mindful of ss.36(2)(a), 36(2)(aa), 36(2A) and 36(2B) of the Act.  It correctly described the terms of these provisions at the commencement of its decision in relation to the refugee criterion and complementary protection criterion. It made findings which involved no misconstruction or misapplication of those legal provisions. In respect of the first ground of the judicial review application, there is no evidence that the Tribunal failed to consider any of the Applicant’s claims or integers of the Applicant’s claims, nor any lack of compliance by the Tribunal with Division 4, Part 7 of the Act which is taken to be an exhaustive statement of the requirements of natural justice in relation to the matters it deals with (s.422B of the Act). Sections 425 and 425A of the Act obliged the Tribunal to invite the Applicant to appear before it to give evidence and present arguments.  The Tribunal clearly complied with that obligation. There is no suggestion, nor any appearance, of the Tribunal failing to properly disclose to the Applicant particular information in accordance with ss.424AA and 424A of the Act.  In the course of reaching its decision, the Tribunal relied on information given by the Applicant during the course of his visa application, and at the Tribunal’s hearing, and independent country information not specifically relating to the Applicant.  The weight to be given to country information is a factual matter for the Tribunal.[3]  The Tribunal’s Decision Record sets out all the issues relevant to the determination of the Applicant’s claim and such issues and material that was adverse to the Applicant was raised with him during the Tribunal’s hearing and, in particular, in the post hearing letter.  Doubts that the Tribunal had regarding the credibility of the Applicant were put to him during the hearing and in the post hearing letter.  The Tribunal said at paragraph 24 of its Decision Record:-  “The Tribunal found that the applicant’s account was inconsistent with [his] earlier account and in other aspects it was vague and lacking in detail. He made several unsubstanted (sic) and unsupported claims. The Tribunal also found aspects of his claims implausible.  The applicant was invited to comment on a number of inconsistencies in a post-hearing letter sent to him pursuant to s424A of the Act (the post hearing letter) ...”[4] And further, at paragraph 59 to 63 inclusive of its Decision Record, the following:-   “Persons coming to his home looking for him and his brother  59.  In his protection visa application the applicant stated that in 2011 and April 2012 unknown men came to his house asking for him and his brother.  In 2012 the applicant was home but managed to escape and hide in a neighbour’s home.  60.  In his statement made 26 February 2014 the applicant said that he believed in early 2012 a white van came for him and[/]or his brother.  61.  His evidence to the Tribunal was that there was only one occasion when the Sri Lanka authorities came looking for him and his brother and this was in 2011.  The Tribunal discussed the discrepancies in the number of times that people came looking for him.  The Tribunal asked if they had come more than once and the applicant said he was not certain, he knew that they came once looking for him.  The Tribunal discussed with him that he had previously said they came on two occasions.  He responded that they may have come he was not sure. The Tribunal put to the applicant that it found it odd that that (sic) his brother had been detained in 2001 and released, apparently had no further problems that the applicant was aware of, that 10 years later they would come looking for him particularly since this was 2 years after the war had ended.  62.  As put in the post hearing letter, the applicant’s brother in his entry interview, protection visa application and interview with the delegate said nothing adverse happened between 2007 and 2012.  After the delegate’s interview he made the claim that the authorities had come looking for him once in 2011 and once in 2012.  His brother said that he had not mentioned these incidents before because he was confused. The Tribunal put to the applicant that as his brother did not mention that the authorities came looking for him in 2011 and 2012 until after his interview with the delegate the Tribunal may form the view that this claim was a recent invention on his brother’s part after he became aware of the applicant’s claims and that his claims were not true regarding people looking for him in 2011 and 2012.  63.  Due to the discrepancies in the applicant’s account and the vague nature of this evidence as to whether they were looking for him or his brother, the fact his brother only supported this claim at a late stage and the fact there would be no reason for the authorities to have an interest in the applicant or his brother at this time, the Tribunal does not accept that armed men came to his home looking for him and/or his brother in 2011 or 2012 and that this led to the applicant leaving Sri Lanka.”[5] The Tribunal found that, based on the family’s past experience, there was no real chance that the Applicant would suffer serious harm or real risk of significant harm on account of his brothers.  While it accepted he had three brothers who lived in England, and accepted that one had been granted asylum, there was no evidence as to why it had been granted or why the other two were able to remain in England. The Tribunal found there was no real chance that the Applicant would be seriously harmed on account of his father or brother.  It accepted his father went missing, and that one of his brothers was detained in 2001 but was not satisfied the father was perceived or imputed to be linked to the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (‘LTTE’), nor did it accept his brother was involved in the LTTE or that his detention was linked to his father’s profile given he had been missing for 10 years at the time of the brother’s detention. Due to the Applicant’s failure to mention the incident in his entry interview and the inconsistencies in his evidence to the Delegate, the Tribunal did not accept that the incident involving the army and his friends during a religious ceremony had occurred.  It was also inconsistent with country information regarding the presence of the Army in Udappu. The Tribunal found the Applicant was prone to exaggeration and did not accept there were daily incidences of round-ups and humiliation. The Tribunal accepted the Applicant might have been detained briefly by police at a sporting competition but, due to the discrepancy in his account as to what occurred when detained, and the fact that he was able to compete when released, the Tribunal found this discrimination did not amount to serious harm for the purposes of s.91R(1)(b) of the Act. The Tribunal accepted unknown people had tried to abduct his nephew after the Applicant left Sri Lanka, but was not satisfied this would lead to a real chance or real risk the Applicant would be harmed. As a result, the Tribunal found the Applicant did not have a well-founded fear of persecution for reasons of his ethnicity or reasons of his membership of the particular social group of Young Tamil Men who are suspected of associating with or supporting the LTTE. The Tribunal accepted that the Applicant would be questioned about his illegal departure but did not accept, based on his past experiences and country information, that this would amount to serious or significant harm and found he did not fall into any of the categories who might be at risk on return. Based on country information, the Tribunal accepted the prison conditions in Sri Lanka are poor and overcrowded, and the Applicant may suffer discomfort whilst in prison on return but found he would be detained for only a short time.  The Tribunal found such detention would be consequent upon the operation of laws of general application and would not amount to persecution.  The Tribunal did not accept that a relatively short period of remand amounted to an act or omission which is intended to cause extreme humiliation which is unreasonable. The Tribunal found that the likelihood of a prison sentence for the Applicant was remote and not a real risk.  It did not accept that the imposition on the Applicant of a fine between 5,000 and 100,000 Sri Lankan rupees would give rise to a real risk of significant harm.  The Tribunal was satisfied the Applicant would be able to pay any fine imposed. The Tribunal found the Applicant did not face a real chance of serious harm in Sri Lanka as a member of a particular social group of failed asylum seekers or Tamil failed asylum seekers who had left illegally, or because he left illegally.  It did not accept he would be imputed with a political opinion as a result of applying for asylum in Australia or that he would be regarded as supporting the LTTE.  Thus, the Tribunal was satisfied that there were no substantial grounds for believing that as a necessary and foreseeable consequence of being removed from Australia to Sri Lanka, there is a real risk the Applicant would suffer significant harm. The Tribunal also considered the Applicant’s claims cumulatively and, on such consideration, concluded there was no real chance the Applicant would be persecuted for a 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees, as amended by the 1967 Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees reason in the reasonably foreseeable future and that his fear of persecution was not well-founded.  Likewise, the Tribunal found that when looking at the Applicant’s claims cumulatively there were no substantial grounds for believing that as a necessary and foreseeable consequence of being removed from Australia to Sri Lanka there was a real risk that he would suffer significant harm. There is no merit to the judicial review application on the grounds as set out in that Application. Indeed nor is there any grounds upon an examination of the decision itself. The application shall be dismissed with costs following the event.I certify that the preceding thirty-three (33) paragraphs are a true copy of the reasons for judgment of Judge HartnettAssociate:  Date: 17 September 2015 [1] Letter from the Refugee Review Tribunal to Mr Sajeethan dated 22 May 2014.[2] First Respondent’s Written Submissions filed on 4 August 2015 at [14.1] – [14.8].[3] NAHI v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (2004) FCAFC 10 at  [11] – [13].[4] Refugee Review Tribunal Decision Record dated 30 June 2014 at [24].[5] Refugee Review Tribunal Decision Record dated 30 June 2014 at [59] – [63].

       " 'MZZOV v Minister for Immigration & Anor [2015] FCCA 3539 (22 September 2015)': ' (EX TEMPORE)  This is an application for a judicial review of a decision by the Refugee Review Tribunal made on 24 June 2013.  The applicant is from Sri Lanka and of Tamil ethnicity. The applicant applied for a protection visa in September 2012.  The applicant appeared before the Tribunal on 28 March 2013 to give evidence and present arguments with the assistance of an interpreter. The Tribunal summarised his claims of risk at paragraph 23 of the decision saying:  The issues to be decided in this case are whether the applicant will be harmed in Sri Lanka because he has a film of an argument with Traffic Police; because of an imputed LTTE connection and anti-government opinion; because of his ethnicity; or because he left Sri Lanka illegally. For the following reasons, the Tribunal has concluded that the decision under review should be affirmed. The Tribunal member then proceeded to carefully deal with the evidence relating to each one of these claims.  The Tribunal dealt with the claim relating to a film of an argument with traffic police at paragraphs 31 to 44.  The Tribunal dealt with the claims relating to an imputed LTTE connection at paragraphs 24 to 30.  The balance of the claims were dealt with in paragraphs 45 through 62.  The Tribunal ultimately concluded that the applicant was not at real risk of significant harm if he were to return to Sri Lanka. The application before this Court was filed in July 2013.  The application lists two grounds as follows:  1. The Refugee Review Tribunal did not afford me procedural fairness.  2. The Refugee Review Tribunal applied the wrong legal test. The hearing of this application was delayed for a considerable period awaiting a decision of the High Court of Australia that may have impacted upon this case.  As it turns out that decision did not have an impact upon the applicant’s case.   During the course of submissions before me the applicant sought an adjournment saying that he had an appointment with the Asylum Seekers Resource Centre some time this week.  The case has been before the Court for over two years.  Notice of this hearing was sent to the parties in February 2015. There is no explanation of the delay in doing anything about preparing his case over the last two years. I am not persuaded that making an appointment to see a legal centre shortly before a hearing that has been listed for so long is a proper basis for an adjournment.   The applicant explained the basis for his grounds of application as being a problem with an interpreter and whether or not the Tribunal considered a medical certificate.  There is no evidence of any particular difficulty with respect to the interpreter at his tribunal hearing. The applicant did not identify any particular exchange or topic of discussion where he says or can explain how a misinterpretation may have impacted upon his hearing.  In these circumstances there is no arguable case of misinterpretation and there is no claim before me that has enough detail to cause me to consider adjourning even for further investigations.   The medical evidence appears in the court book at page 219.  The Tribunal discusses these issues at paragraphs 38 and 42.  I am not persuaded that it is arguable that the Tribunal failed to properly consider this evidence, nor that they did not afford the applicant procedural fairness on this issue. It is not apparent from reading the Tribunal’s decision that they applied the wrong legal test, nor has there been any argument pointing out any error in the legal test that the Tribunal applied.   In the circumstances, I dismiss the application. [further argument ensued] In this case, the Minister has been entirely successful.  Costs ordinarily follow the event in ordinary civil litigation.  The scale fee for a case of this type is $6825.  The Minister should have his costs. I, therefore, formally order that.I certify that the preceding twelve (12) paragraphs are a true copy of the reasons for judgment of Judge RiethmullerDate:  14 January 2016       ',\n",
       " 'MZZWU & Anor v Minister for Immigration & Anor [2015] FCCA 2443 (24 September 2015)': '  This is an application filed 5 December 2013 seeking judicial review of a determination of the Refugee Review Tribunal (“the Tribunal”) made 11 November 2013 affirming a decision of the Minister’s Delegate to not grant the applicants each a Protection (Class XA) visa (“the visa”) . The first applicant appears in person. He has not filed written submissions pursuant to the orders and directions of the Registrar made 19 February 2014. The application first came before me on 2 July 2014 and was that day dismissed by reason of the absence of the applicant and pursuant to rule 13.03C(1)(c) of the Federal Circuit Court Rules 2001 (Cth) (“the Rules”), together with an order for costs. My reasons for judgment on that day also encompass a consideration of the merits of the application[1] where at [42] I conclude:  For the reasons set out above, I find no merit in the application for a judicial review. The applicants did not attend the hearing.  Consequently, the application will be dismissed pursuant to rule 13.03(c) of the Federal Circuit Court Rules 2001. On 21 April 2015 the applicants filed a further application seeking to have my orders of 2 July 2014 set aside. That application was accompanied by an affidavit of the first applicant setting out the reasons for his non-attendance at the hearing on 2 July 2014 summarised as follows:  (i)  that the applicants did not have legal representation and were not therefore aware of the “legal consequences” of the hearing;  and  (ii) that the first applicant could not attend the hearing because of his wife’s illness. A hearing of that application was listed for 5 June 2015. The applicants again did not appear and the application was again dismissed under rule 13.03C(1)(d) of the Rules.   On 11 June 2015 the applicants filed yet another application seeking to have my orders of 5 June 2015 set aside.  A further affidavit was filed by the first applicant deposing that he did not receive notice of the relisting of the matter at 9.15 am on that day, it having previously been listed at 2.15 pm. Issues:  The Court file shows that the applicant was advised of the relisting date by letter of 11 May 2015 sent to his correct address for service. The applicant now appears in person and is unrepresented.  He provided no written submissions.  He was invited to make oral submissions and said that his non-attendance was due to his “wife being hospitalised”.  It appears to me that this submission may be confusing the applicant’s position with his non-attendance on 21 April 2015. The first respondent Minister argues that, regardless of the adequacy of the applicant’s explanation for non-appearance at the hearing on 5 June 2015, the application is bound to fail.  That is, it is argued that there is a lack of utility in setting aside the previous order. The Court, of course, has a discretion under rule 16.05(2)(a) of the Rules and I accept the submissions of Counsel for the first respondent that the following broad considerations are relevant:  (i)  the adequacy of the applicants’ explanation for their absence at the hearing;  (ii) the length of time between the Court’s orders dismissing the proceeding and the making of the first application to have those orders set aside; and  (iii) the merits of the substantive application. The applicants’ explanation for the failure to attend the hearing on 2 July 2014 is set out above.  Nevertheless, it is well-established that the applicant has the onus of making proper inquiries and taking reasonable action to review a Tribunal’s decision within the applicable time limits.  As such, I am not satisfied that a lack of legal representation of itself is sufficient to explain the applicants’ non-appearance in the absence of further particulars or argument.[2] No medical evidence was provided to the Court in support of the applicant’s wife’s illness and how that would prevent the first applicant attending at the Court for what would ordinarily be a hearing of short duration.  It is clear that no adjournment was sought or prior notice given to the Court or the first respondent.[3]  Conclusion.  In any event, and as set out above, my reasons of 2 July 2014 go further than simply dismissing the application pursuant to rule 13.03C of the Rules and address the merits of the application.  No challenge or argument is now brought by the first applicant in respect of my determination.  In such circumstances, I am persuaded in the terms of the first respondent’s argument that there would be no utility in granting the application to set aside the orders dismissing the application. [4]  The application will be dismissed with costs.I certify that the preceding fourteen (14) paragraphs are a true copy of the reasons for judgment of Judge McGuireDate: 24 September 2015 [1] MZZWU v Minister for Immigration and Border Protection [2014] FCCA 1425[2] Manna v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2013] FCA 400 [17][3] NAKX v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCA 1559 at  [6][4] Lee v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2001] FCA 1448 at  [10].

       " 'Moussa v Minister for Immigration & Anor [2015] FCCA 1879 (9 July 2015)': '  This is an application in a case seeking an order to withdraw a notice of discontinuance that was filed on 16 June 2015.  The originating application was filed on 7 April 2015 seeking a Constitutional writ within the Court’s jurisdiction under s.476 of the Migration Act 1958 in respect of a decision of the Tribunal made on 30 January 2015, holding that the Tribunal did not have jurisdiction in respect of a decision of the delegate made on 24 October 2014 refusing to grant the applicant a Partner (Temporary) (Class UK) visa.   The applicant arrived in Australia on 20 December 2011 on a subclass TU-573 visa, which was cancelled on 28 October 2012.  The applicant applied for a Protection visa on 11 October 2012, which was refused on 14 February 2013.  The applicant appealed to the Refugee Review Tribunal on 25 February 2013 and the delegate’s decision was affirmed on 1 July 2014.  The applicant unsuccessfully sought ministerial intervention by applying on 31 July 2014, which application was rejected on 19 August 2014.  The applicant lodged the application for review the subject of these proceedings, on 28 April 2014. In that application for review to the Tribunal, the applicant identified an authorised recipient, which included an electronic communication, email address for that authorised recipient in respect of the review process.   The applicant deposed to the fact that he became aware of information in the Court book that the applicant asserted the authorised agent in the application for review had no authority to convey.  The applicant asserted that he became aware of this information after he had filed the notice of discontinuance.  The applicant gave evidence that he had appointed a migration agent to act on his behalf in relation to the application for the Partner (Temporary) (Class UK) visa and that it was not until the filing of the application in the case in this court that the applicant purported to terminate any authority of the agent.   The applicant gave oral evidence that prior to filing the notice of discontinuance he had consulted a number of lawyers and that none of them had advised him to continue his case.  The applicant gave evidence that some of the lawyers he consulted had the benefit of the Court book that he received on 2 June 2015.  It was clear from the applicant’s evidence that he knew what he was doing when he filed a notice of discontinuance.  The applicant, however, said that he would not have filed that notice of discontinuance if he had been aware of assertions made by his authorised recipient that were in the Court book and which the applicant said were untrue and were fabricated.   The communication to which the applicant drew attention was an email dated 22 December 2014 to the Tribunal in response to the Tribunal’s letter dated 8 December 2014.  The letter from the Tribunal dated 8 December 2015 identified that the application for review did not appear to be valid within s.347 of the Act as it was lodged outside the 21-day period.  The email dated 22 December 2014 asserted that the applicant had been very sick due to chicken pox and was suffering financial hardship, and the applicant gave sworn evidence that these matters were untrue and were alleged to have been fabricated by the agent. These alleged false facts were not material to the existence of jurisdiction or any relevant discretion. The applicant also gave evidence that the application for review in this Court had filed with it an affidavit sworn 7 April 2014 which annexed the decision of the Tribunal and requested an opportunity to resubmit sufficient evidence so as to grant the application for a visa.  The applicant swore that the signature on that affidavit was not his.  The existence of the proceedings was clearly a matter in respect of which the applicant was alive in consulting lawyers and lodging the notice of discontinuance. The alleged false affidavit has no material impact on the jurisdictional issue before the Tribunal. The applicant contended that the agent had engaged in unauthorised acts by reason of which the applicant had an arguable case of jurisdictional error by the Tribunal, and that the applicant should be allowed to withdraw the notice of discontinuance.   The applicant pointed to the email of 22 December 2014 and the alleged fraudulent affidavit sworn 7 April 2014 as evidencing fraudulent activity of the agent of a kind that meant no longer acting within the scope of his authority such as to give rise to a jurisdictional error.  Respondent identified the importance of the principle of finality in respect of litigation, and that this principle informed the limited circumstances in which the Court had jurisdiction to permit the setting aside of a notice of discontinuance.  The first respondent submitted that the jurisdiction to set aside a notice of discontinuance was a narrow power to be exercised to prevent an injustice only in exceptional circumstances, such as fraud or abuse of process.   The first respondent drew the Court’s attention to the principles identified in Jalloh v Minister for Immigration & Anor [2015] FCCA 1154 at  [9] and [10]; MZZDN v Minister for Immigration & Anor  [2015] FCCA 69 at  [15], [44]-[47], [51], [55]-[56]; and Khadri v Minister for Immigration and Border Protection  [2014] FCA 91 at  [16].   The first respondents submitted that the applicant had not made out a case of fraud or abuse of process so as to enliven the Court’s jurisdiction.  The first respondent submitted that this was a case where the applicant had received legal advice and understood the effect of what the applicant was doing.  The first respondent submitted that there was no relevant fraud or abuse of process in relation to the applicant’s decision to discontinue the proceedings. The first respondent drew attention to the fact that the applicant was armed with the Court book at the time deciding to lodge the notice of discontinuance, and that there was no operative conduct by the agent that could be said to have been the cause of the applicant lodging the notice of discontinuance, or conduct to support an abuse of process of a kind that would enliven the Court’s jurisdiction to permit the notice of discontinuance to be withdrawn.   It is, of course, of serious concern that the applicant alleges an authorised recipient, who is apparently a migration agent, is said to have provided unauthorised information by the email dated 22 December 2014, and is alleged to have forged the applicant’s signature on the affidavit sworn 7 April 2015.  Whilst I am prepared to accept on the evidence before this court that the agent engaged in unauthorised activity in respect of the email dated 22 December 2014, and in respect to the affidavit sworn 7 April 2015, that is not conduct of a kind that constitutes exceptional circumstances to warrant the setting aside of the notice of discontinuance. The alleged fraudulent activity does not go to the applicant’s understanding of the notice of discontinuance or the applicant’s understanding of the merits of his case as to the existence of jurisdictional error by the Tribunal. It was apparent from the applicant’s evidence that he appreciated that a decision had been made by the Tribunal in February of 2015, and the application lodged for Constitutional writs was one in respect of which an extension of time under s.477 was required.   A s.477 application generally requires an adequate explanation for the failure to lodge the application within the time limit under s.477, as well as a sufficiently arguable case of jurisdictional error to warrant an extension of time in the interests of the administration of justice.   In this case, notwithstanding the criticisms of the agent, on the applicant’s own evidence of the knowledge of the applicant of the decision of the Tribunal, I am not satisfied that there is an adequate explanation for the delay.  Further, the grounds in the application in this case clearly fail to identify any jurisdictional error. The alleged fraudulent activity by the agent in this case even if accepted is not capable of giving rise to any jurisdictional error by the Tribunal. In this case, it is clear from the application that the authorised recipient was notified within s.347 by the transmission method of email to the authorised email address and pursuant to s.494D and s.494C that is taken to be effective notification to the applicant.   The grounds of the application are as follows:  1. I have married to my wife and all legal paperwork has been submit to the DIBP however it was refused.  2. I believe that my aplication with all support documents has been met the visa requirement that should to be granted.  3. I have supported all required document to the tribunal member. Those grounds in the application fail to identify any jurisdictional error.   The Tribunal notified the authorised recipient for the applicant of the potentially dispositive issue, in terms of the late lodgement of the application for review. The Tribunal was in the circumstances of the notification to the authorised recipient by email, correct in its finding that it had no jurisdiction.   Accordingly, even if this Court had a broader jurisdiction to set aside the notice of discontinuance than fraud or abuse of process, this is not a case in which in the interests of the administration of justice could be said to require an extension of time under s.477. The application to set aside the notice of discontinuance should be refused.  The application in the case is dismissed.I certify that the preceding twenty-three (23) paragraphs are a true copy of the reasons for judgment of Judge StreetAssociate:  Date:  15 July 2015       ',\n",
       " 'Potier v Minister for Immigration & Anor [2015] FCCA 3362 (15 December 2015)': '  This is an urgent interlocutory application for injunctive relief to restrain the deportation of the applicant.  Mr Brezniak, counsel for the applicant seeks to rely upon this Court’s jurisdiction invoked through s.476 of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) in respect of a decision of the Tribunal made on 17 November 2015 holding that the Tribunal did not have jurisdiction in the matter.  The reasons of the Tribunal identified the requirements in respect of a person in detention to make an application for review within two days in accordance with s.347(1)(b) and reg.4.10. Regulation 4.11 provides as follows:  (1)  An application for review by the Tribunal must be given to the Tribunal by:              (a)  leaving it with an officer of the Tribunal at a registry of the Tribunal, or with a person specified in a direction given by the President of the Tribunal under section 18B of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 ; or              (b)  sending the application by pre-paid post to a registry of the Tribunal; or              (c)  having the application delivered by post, or by hand, to an address specified in a direction given by the President of the Tribunal under section 18B of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 ; or              (d)  faxing the application to a fax number specified in a direction given by the President of the Tribunal under section 18B of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 ; or              (e)  transmitting it to a registry of the Tribunal by other electronic means specified in a direction given by the President of the Tribunal under section 18B of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 .              (2)  An application made to the Tribunal in accordance with paragraph (1)(a) or (b) is taken to have been received by the Tribunal at the time the Tribunal receives it.              (3)  An application made to the Tribunal in accordance with paragraph (1)(c) is taken to have been received by the Tribunal at the time it is received at the relevant address.              (4)  An application made to the Tribunal in accordance with paragraph (1)(d) is taken to have been received by the Tribunal at the time it is received at the relevant fax number.              (5)  An application made to the Tribunal in accordance with paragraph (1)(e) is taken to have been received by the Tribunal at the time the Tribunal receives it. In the present case the Tribunal found that the application had not been received until 9 November 2015.  The relevant two days in this case expired on 6 November 2015.  For the purposes of this application, I accept that the issue of whether the application was lodged within the two workings days is a jurisdictional fact. Evidence was adduced by the applicant purporting to explain circumstances in which the applicant contended that notification was in fact given to the Tribunal on 6 November. The explanation by the applicant in relation to how lodgement was made on 6 November 2015 is less than satisfactory.  The applicant apparently had some unidentified and unexplained medical issue, by reason of which he purported to delegate the task of transmitting what he knew to be a critical timeframe for service of the document to a third party.  It is not apparent from the affidavit of the applicant that the applicant was ever given any basis on 6 November to conclude that the document had been lodged on that date. A diary note was tendered that I find is inconsistent with the assertion by the applicant that the application was faxed to the Tribunal on 6 November 2015. Annexed to the applicant’s affidavit was a facsimile report printed out on 15 November 2015, apparently provided to the applicant as a result of communications made subsequent to the Tribunal raising with the applicant the issue of jurisdiction. The document does not prove transmission of the application to the Tribunal. The applicant’s evidence, in my opinion, falls well short of establishing a prima facie case in relation to the lodgement of the application within the two days required under s.347(1)(b) and reg.4.10.  I am not satisfied that there is any arguable case, let alone a prima facie case, of jurisdictional error by the Tribunal in identifying that it did not have jurisdiction. On the material before the Court, the application was not received by the Tribunal until 9 November 2015. I accept the first respondent’s submission that reg.4.11(4) makes clear that the application must in fact be received by the Tribunal in order to properly found the Tribunal’s jurisdiction.  I should add that even if there had been a prima facie case relating to potential jurisdiction by the Tribunal to reconsider the delegate’s decision, this is not a case where there appears to be any seriously arguable prospect of the applicant being able to make out the requirements for a bridging visa.  The delegate identified that the applicant failed to meet the criteria for the grant of a subclass 050 bridging visa under cl.050.212.  I was informed that the applicant wished to contend that the criteria in that regard could somehow be met because of an endeavour by the applicant to obtain a criminal justice stay warrant.  On 3 December 2015 the Court of Appeal dismissed an application for leave to appeal in relation to the applicant’s pursuit of a criminal justice stay warrant. In the course of that decision the Court identified that the applicant had been tried and convicted of two counts of solicit to murder.  The applicant’s appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal against conviction and an application for special leave to appeal to the High Court have been dismissed.  The circumstances are that the applicant has served the sentence in relation to those two offences.  However, whilst in custody the applicant was charged for the third time with a new offence of solicit to murder and was convicted and has been given a further sentence, which has not yet been served.   The appeal against conviction on the third offence of solicit to murder was dismissed by the Court of Criminal Appeal and there has been filed an application for special leave that has not yet been determined.  The proceedings by the applicant contesting his third conviction in relation to solicit to murder does not give rise to any criteria being fulfilled under cl.050.212.  The special leave proceedings in the High Court of Australia is not a basis upon which the applicant could succeed in obtaining any bridging visa. To the extent that the applicant is pursuing proceedings for a criminal justice stay warrant, those proceedings have been unsuccessful at first instance and unsuccessful in the Court of Appeal and, on the face of that decision there is no basis to conclude that there is any real prospect of a grant of special leave being made in favour of the applicant.  I should add that the existence of other proceedings in another court are not a basis ordinarily upon which interlocutory relief will be granted by this Court.  This Court’s powers to grant interlocutory relief depend upon the invocation of the substantive jurisdiction of this Court.  Even assuming that there is an arguable application for special leave in the High Court of Australia either against the third conviction or on the refusal of the criminal justice stay warrant, that is not a basis that gives rise to a prima facie case for a granting of interlocutory relief in this Court. The applicant in the present case has been the subject of steps being taken as required by law pursuant to s.198 of the Migration Act 1958 for the removal of the applicant from Australia, the applicant being an unlawful non-citizen.  The objects of the Act are identified in s.4, and the purpose of the Migration Act 1958 includes the protection of Australian citizens.  The delegate identified in the delegate’s decision dated 3 November 2015 that the background of the applicant was such that one would be obliged to refer the applicant for consideration of refusal of the visa on character grounds given the applicant’s criminal convictions. Section 501 of the Migration Act 1958 identifies character grounds as being a reason why a visa may be refused or cancelled.  No issue was raised in the present case of any excess of power under s.198 in relation to the removal of the applicant from Australia as an unlawful non-citizen. Taking into account, as a matter of balance of convenience, the public interest in the protection of Australian citizens, this is not a case where the Court is persuaded that the balance of convenience weighs in favour of granting any interlocutory relief. I have taken into account the possibility of an arguable case being raised in relation to the refusal of the jurisdiction of the Tribunal and/or the possibility of an arguable issue being raised in the application for a special leave.  None of those matters outweigh the important public interest in the protection of Australian citizens and the lawful removal of the applicant as an unlawful non-citizen under s.198 in the present case.  I have also taken into account the invocation of this Court’s jurisdiction in relation to the decision of the Tribunal. The lodging of applications for review and the commencement of proceedings are not of themselves grounds upon which the removal of a person who is an unlawful non-citizen under s.198 should be the subject of interlocutory injunctive relief.  For the reasons I have given, no prima facie case to support injunctive relief has been made out in the present circumstances. Further, for the above reasons the balance of convenience weighs against the grant of any interlocutory injunction. It is appropriate to also make reference to the fact that there have been other proceedings taken in the last few days by the applicant, it appears, in the Federal Court of Australia substantially seeking the same relief to the effect of restraining the removal of the applicant from Australia.  The Court does not have the benefit of the reasons for decision in those cases but it was identified that an application at first instance had been refused by Markovic J on the grounds of a want of jurisdiction and that an application for leave to appeal had been refused by Perram J on the grounds that there was no error in the decision of the learned Justice at first instance. It was suggested by the applicant’s counsel that remarks were made by Perram J as to the potential existence of a cogent argument that might support the grant for relief in some other forum.  Nothing said by counsel for the applicant identified, in my opinion, any cogent basis upon which it could be said there should be a grant of interlocutory relief in the present case.   It is necessary for the representative of the applicant to file and serve a proper initiating process consistent with the Court rules reflecting the substance of the application that was brought urgently before this Court in respect of the decision of the Tribunal of 17 November 2015.   The application for an interlocutory injunction is dismissed.I certify that the preceding eighteen (18) paragraphs are a true copy of the reasons for judgment of Judge StreetAssociate: Date: 18 December 2015       ',\n",
       " 'Rahman & Ors v Minister for Immigration & Anor [2016] FCCA 117 (1 December 2015)': \"  The following brief reasons have been revised from the transcript. On 31st August 2015, this matter was fixed for hearing on 1st December 2015. On that occasion, Mr Ford appeared on behalf of all of the Applicants then listed.  The Respondent Minister was also represented.  A timetable was agreed between the parties for the filing of written submissions, as well as for the filing of the usual Court Book of relevant documents.  An order was also made giving the Applicant leave to file an Amended Application.  In the result, no amended Application was filed. Written submissions on behalf of all parties were filed in accordance with the orders made on 31st August 2015: the Applicants’ submissions were filed on 17th November 2015; the Respondent filed submissions on 24th November 2015.   On 1st December 2015, at the scheduled time for the hearing of 2:15pm, and there being no appearance by or on behalf of the Applicants, the matter was called.  There was no response to the call. The Court is acutely conscious of (a) the often dire circumstances of Applicants in matters of the kind before the Court, and therefore the need to deal with such Applications as expeditiously and fairly as possible, and (b) the oppressively large number of matters that are required to be dealt with by this Court across its very broad jurisdiction. Such considerations, in materially and procedurally different contexts, were relevantly dealt with by the High Court in the well-known, signal cases of AON Risk Services Australia Limited v Australian National University (“AON”) and Expense Reduction Analysts Group Pty Ltd v Armstrong Strategic Management and Marketing Pty Ltd (“Expense Reduction”).[1] In AON, the High Court emphasised that the resources of courts require diligent attention to the “proper and efficient use of [these] public resources.”[2]  Similar comments were made by the High Court in Expense Reduction, for example at [51], where the Court referred to   Speed and efficiency, in the sense of minimum delay and expense, are essential to a just resolution of proceedings.  The achievement of a just but timely and cost-effective resolution of a dispute has effects not only upon the parties but upon the court and other litigants. I recognise very readily that the current proceeding is not a commercial matter, and that the plight of the Applicants is a significant consideration.  However, in this matter they are legally represented.  The Court has allocated time to and resources for the resolution of the current review Application.  The Applicants’ lawyer was plainly aware of the date of the hearing.  This is evidenced not only by his presence at the first return date on 31st August when orders were made by consent fixing the matter for hearing, but also because he complied with the Orders made on that occasion.  Further, Order 4 made last August required the solicitor for the Applicants to file an outline of submissions “on or before 14 days prior to the hearing.”  The Solicitor for the Applicants complied with this Order. The Court cannot conduct a hearing with one party only, least of all, in this instance, in the absence of the moving parties. Division 13.1A of this Court’s Rules provide for the Court’s powers for judgment “on default.”  In particular, Rule 13.03C provides as follows:  (1)  If a party to a proceeding is absent from a hearing (including a first court date), the Court may do 1 or more of the following:                       (a)  adjourn the hearing to a specific date or generally;                       (b)  order that there is not to be any hearing, unless:                                (i)  the proceeding is again set down for hearing; or                               (ii)  any other steps that the Court directs are taken;                       (c)  if the absent party is an applicant—dismiss the application;                       (d)  if the absent party is a party who has made an interlocutory application or a crossclaim—dismiss the interlocutory application or crossclaim;                       (e)  proceed with the hearing generally or in relation to any claim for relief in the proceeding.               (2)  If a party to a proceeding is absent from a hearing, the Court may also make an order of the kind mentioned in subrule 13.03B(1), (2) or (4), or any other order, or may give any directions, and specify any consequences for noncompliance with the order, that the Court thinks just. In commenting on the Rules of the Federal Court of Australia as they then were (now r.5.22), in Lenijamar Pty Ltd v AGC (Advances) Ltd [1990] FCA 520;  (1990) 27 FCR 388;  98 ALR 200, the Full Court of the Federal Court said, at FCR 395 and 396 (Wilcox and Gummow JJ) (emphasis added):  It is to be noted that the power given by this rule is conditioned on one circumstance only: the failure of a party to comply with an order of the court directing that party to take a step in the proceeding. There is no requirement of intentional default or contumelious conduct, although the attitude of the applicant to the default and the court's judgment as to whether or not the applicant genuinely wishes the matter to go to trial within a reasonable period will usually be important factors in weighing the proper exercise of the discretion conferred by the rule. There is no requirement of “inordinate and inexcusable delay” on the part of the applicant or the applicant's lawyers, although any such delay is likely to be a significant matter. There is no requirement of prejudice to the respondent, although the existence of prejudice is also likely to be significant....  ... The discretion conferred by O 10, r 7 is unconfined, except for the condition of non-compliance with a direction. As it is impossible to foresee all of the circumstances under which the rule might be sought to be used, it is undesirable to make any exhaustive statement of the circumstances under which the power granted by the rule will appropriately be exercised. We will not attempt to do so. But two situations are obvious candidates for the exercise of the power: cases in which the history of non-compliance by an applicant is such as to indicate an inability or unwillingness to cooperate with the court and the other party or parties in having the matter ready for trial within an acceptable period and cases — whatever the applicant's state of mind or resources — in which the non-compliance is continuing and occasioning unnecessary delay, expense or other prejudice to the respondent. Their Honours’ detailed exposition has been cited with approval regularly, such as by the Full Court in Welsh v Digilin.[3] Unfortunately, in all of the circumstances, and in particular with no appearance by or on behalf of the Applicants, the Application filed on 4th August 2015 must be dismissed, pursuant to Rule 13.03C of this Court’s Rules, with an order for costs in accordance with Schedule 1 Part 3 of the Federal Circuit Court Rules 2001.I certify that the preceding fifteen (15) paragraphs are a true copy of the reasons for judgment of Judge NevilleAssociate:  Date:  22 January 2016 [1] AON Risk Services Australia Limited v Australian National University (2009) 239 CLR 175; Expense Reduction Analysts Group Pty Ltd v Armstrong Strategic Management and Marketing Pty Ltd [2013] HCA 46;  (2013) 250 CLR 303.[2] AON at CLR [23] and [24] (French CJ); [72] (Gummow, Hayne, Crennan, Kiefel and Bell JJ: “... to minimise the delay and expense of proceedings ...”).

       " 'SZNQS v Minister for Immigration & Anor [2015] FCCA 3124 (23 November 2015)': \"  This is an application for a Constitutional writ within the Court’s jurisdiction under s.476 of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) in respect to a decision of the Tribunal made on 31 July 2015, affirming a decision of the delegate not to grant the applicant a protection visa.   The applicant was found to be a citizen of India.  The applicant arrived in Australia on 27 October 2008, on a visa subclass 676 visa.  On 6 November 2008, the applicant made an application for protection which was refused on 5 January 2009.  A review was sought by the applicant on 16 January 2009, and on 29 April 2009 the Tribunal affirmed the decision of the delegate.  The applicant then sought judicial review in the Federal Court of Australia on 3 June 2009, which was dismissed on 28 October 2009.  The applicant sought a review in the Full Court of the Federal Court of Australia on 26 November 2009, which was dismissed on 18 February 2010.  The applicant commenced proceedings in the High Court of Australia on 8 March 2010, which I assume was an application for special leave, which was dismissed on 18 June 2010.   The applicant unsuccessfully sought ministerial intervention, and on 10 October 2010, lodged a second application for protection, consistent with the decision of the Full Federal Court in SZGIZ v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship (2013) 212 FCR 35 in respect of complementary protection.   On 17 July 2014, the delegate rejected the second application for protection on the grounds of complementary protection and made adverse findings in relation to the applicant’s credibility.  The applicant claimed to fear harm by reason of his political opinion, and both his and his father’s involvement in the BJP.  The applicant also claimed to fear harm on the basis he would targeted by Muslim extremists, given that he was a Hindu.   The Tribunal found the applicant was not a witness of truth.  The Tribunal found that the applicant had embellished, if not fabricated, part of his claims.  The Tribunal rejected the applicant’s claims as false, and found the alleged involvement by the applicant and his father in the BJP was false.  The Tribunal was not satisfied that there was a real risk the applicant would suffer significant harm by reason of any of the claims advanced.  The Tribunal found that there was no real risk the applicant will suffer significant harm if returned to India.   The Tribunal accordingly found the applicant was not a person in respect of whom Australia had protection obligations, and that the criteria under s.36(2)(aa) of the Act had not been made out.   On 8 October 2015, a Registrar of the Court fixed the matter for hearing and made orders providing an opportunity for the filing of an amended application, affidavit evidence and submissions.  No such documents were filed.  The application identifies the following grounds:  1. The second respondent failed to comply with the mandatory requirement under section 424A(read with section 424AA) of the Migration Act to give the applicant clear particulars of information it considered would be part of the reason for affirming the decision under review, to ensure the applicant understood why that information was relevant to the review and the consequence of its being relied upon, and to invite the applicant to comment upon or respond to that information.  Particular:  The Tribunal did not issue any written invitation under section 424A of the Act and, made no attempt to, and did not comply with the requirements set out in section 424AA of the Act.  2. The Tribunal's decision was unjust and made without taking in to account the full gravity of Applicant's circumstances and consequences of claims. The Tribunal did not consider the applicant who had been under immense and intimidating pressure from opposition. In relation to ground 1, I accept the first respondent’s submission that there was no information enlivening any obligation under s.424A.  I accept the first respondent’s submission that the country information fell within the exception under 424A.  Accordingly, there is no basis for any allegation of breach of s.424A, and ground 1 fails to make out any jurisdictional error.   In relation to ground 2, it is clear the applicant was invited, by letter dated 25 May 2015, to appear at a hearing on 28 July 2015, to give evidence and present arguments.  The applicant appeared on that date, to give evidence and present arguments, and was assisted by an interpreter represented by his registered migration agent.   The Tribunal’s reasons reveal a comprehensive review, and there is no basis upon which it could be said the review was unjust or that there was any non-compliance with the statutory regime.  The proposition that the Tribunal did not address the applicant’s claims and circumstances is without substance. It was a matter for the Tribunal whether it accepted the applicant’s claims in relation to his involvement with the BJP, and ground 2 appears to be nothing more than an impermissible challenge to the merits of the matter, which it is for the Tribunal to determine.  Ground 2 fails to make out any jurisdictional error.   From the bar table, the applicant indicated that he could not accurately remember dates.  It is clear from paras.10 and 11 that the Tribunal took into account the nature of the applicant’s responses in determining whether or not it was satisfied that the applicant was given a real opportunity to put his evidence and submissions.  Nothing said by the applicant from the bar table identified any basis upon which it could be said there was any jurisdictional error.  The applicant maintained that there was an election that was taking place, and therefore he could not return.   This Court does not have jurisdiction to make findings of fact in relation to the applicant’s claimed fears of persecution, or claimed fears or suffering significant harm.  The applicant’s reference to the current election that is taking place is not a matter that gives rise to any arguable ground of jurisdictional error by the Tribunal.   The application is dismissed.

       " 'SZQTJ v Minister for Immigration & Anor [2015] FCCA 3226 (3 December 2015)': '  This is an application for a Constitutional writ within the Court’s jurisdiction under s.476 of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) in respect of a decision of the Tribunal made on 14 July 2015 affirming a decision of the delegate not to grant the applicant a protection visa.  The applicant was found to be a citizen of Nepal, and his second application on the grounds of complementary protection was made on 15 April 2013 and was refused by the delegate on 10 June 2014. On 17 September 2008, the applicant was granted a student visa TU 572 and arrived in Australia on 2 October 2008 and departed on 2 May 2009.  On 22 May 2009, the applicant reentered Australia and departed on 13 January 2010.  On 16 February 2010, the applicant reentered Australia and applied for protection on 14 January 2011.  That application for protection was dealt with under s.36(2)(a) of the Migration Act 1958 and not under s.36(2)(aa) of the Migration Act 1958. In a decision dated 13 April 2011, the delegate, in respect of the first application for protection as a refugee, found the applicant had a particular sexual orientation but found that the applicant was not entitled to protection.  The Tribunal’s decision dated 14 September 2011 on the first application also accepted that the applicant had a particular sexual orientation but found that the applicant was not entitled to protection and did not satisfy the criteria under s.36(2)(a) of the Migration Act 1958 for a protection visa.   The applicant’s claims were that he had to conceal his sexual orientation in Nepal and feared that he would face harassment and discrimination by reason of his sexual orientation.   The Tribunal dealt with the second application for protection on the basis of the provisions identified in s.36(2)(aa) of the Migration Act 1958, consistent with the decision in SZGIZ v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship (2013) 212 FCR 35.  The Tribunal raised with the applicant a live issue in respect of the applicant’s sexual orientation and came to a different finding in relation to the applicant’s sexuality for reasons that cannot be said to lack an evident and intelligible justification.  The Tribunal also addressed whether there was a risk of the applicant suffering serious harm if, in fact, the applicant’s claims as to his sexual orientation were true.  The Tribunal found that the applicant did not face a real risk of significant harm on return to Nepal in relation to his claims.   The delegate, in relation to the second application, in fact addressed the claims both under ss.36(2)(a) and 36(2)(aa) Migration Act 1958 in the decision dated 14 June 2014, and found that the applicant was not a person in respect of whom Australia had a protection obligation and that the criteria under ss.36(2)(a) and 36(2)(aa) was not made out.   The ground of the application is as follows:   1. The Tribunal erred by failing to consider whether Australia had protection obligations under the Refugees Convention and Protocol in respect of the Applicant.  Particulars  The Applicant had previously been refused a protection visa under s36(2)(a) of the Migration Act 1958. The Applicant then lodged a new application for a protection visa relying on s36(2)(aa). The Tribunal held that it was precluded from considering the grounds in s36(2)(a), and did not do so in relation to application for a Protection Visa. The Tribunal misinterpreted s48A, which operates only to determine whether an application for a protection visa is valid, not what the Tribunal may and may not consider when making its determination. At the time of the second protection application, s.48A provided, relevantly, as follows:  Section 48A  (1) Subject to section 48B, a non-citizen who, while in the migration zone, has made:  (a) an application for a protection visa, where the grant of the visa has been refused (whether or not the application has been finally determined); ... may not make a further application for a protection visa while in the migration zone. ...  (2) In this section: application for a protection visa includes:   (aa) an application for a visa, a criterion for which is mentioned in paragraph 36(2)(a), (aa), (b) or (c); and It is also appropriate to take into account the scheme of the Act under Pt.7 which identifies the obligation of the Tribunal to conduct a review under s.414 where a valid application has been made under s.412.  For the reasons given in SZGIZ at para.49, the second application was a valid application as follows:   49. In our view, that passage simply begs the question whether the earlier making of an unsuccessful application based on a particular criterion prevents the making of a subsequent application for a protection visa relying on a different criterion. Consistent with SZGIZ, the Tribunal was required to review the complementary protection application that had not been referenced and had powers relevantly under s.415(1):  For the purpose of the review the Tribunal may exercise all the powers and discretions that are conferred by the Act on the delegate.   The decision in SZGIZ, in substance, permits the applicant to make a second application for protection “relying on different criterion”.  Those words quoted above from the judgment of the single judgment of the Full Court of the Federal Court of Australia are of significance in relation to the nature of the review that the Tribunal is entitled to conduct under Pt.7.  The language of s.48A, on its terms, imposed a bar upon consideration of another application under s.36(2)(a) that had already been refused.   The mere fact that the delegate may have made a jurisdictional error or misunderstood the scope of the entitlement of the applicant to make a second application under the principles identified in SZGIZ does not, in any way, impact upon the scope of the jurisdiction of the Tribunal or its obligations under the statutory regime.  The Court was taken to a decision of this Court in SZVCH v Minister for Immigration and Border Protection  [2015] FCCA 2950, particularly at [24] to [26], in which a reasoning was adopted to the effect that if the delegate engaged in an analysis of protection, under s.36(2)(a), the Tribunal was required to do likewise.  There is no statutory foundation for that approach.  That construction is inconsistent with the clear words of the statutory mandate in s.48A.  Further, the approach in SZVCH is, in my opinion, inconsistent with the binding decision of the Full Court in SZGIZ, which makes clear that a second application can only be one relying on a different criterion.  I note that the reasoning in the decision in SZVCH was made without express reference to the critical ratio of the decision in SZGIZ at para.49.  In AOM15 v Minister for Immigration and Border Protection [2015] FCA 1285, Perram J said at [9] as follows:  9. The appellant then sought a review before the Tribunal. At the hearing before the Tribunal it correctly identified that the only issue was complementary protection and that SZGIZ did not justify any further examination of the issue of whether a protection visa should be issued for Refugee Convention reasons. In my opinion, what was said by the learned Perram J in AOM15 is inconsistent with the reasoning adopted in SZVCH v Minister for Immigration and Border Protection [2015] FCCA 2950. The decision of Perram J was delivered after the decision of SZVCH. This Court is bound by the decision in SZGIZ and the decision in SZVCH cannot be reconciled with the binding authority of the Full Court. Nor can SZVCH be reconciled with AOM15.  I am satisfied that the decision in SZVCH is plainly wrong.  For these reasons, I am satisfied that there is no jurisdictional error of the kind identified in ground 1 of the application.   I note, for the record, that a formal submission was made on behalf of the first respondent challenging SZGIZ on the basis of a construction of s.48A that the first respondent contends in its form, as it then stood, excluded a second application, even be it of different criterion.  That is not an issue that was advanced beyond the formal submission in this Court and the decision of the Full Court is binding upon this Court. I note, however, that the formal submission is not one that, if correct, would have assisted the applicant on the present case.  From the bar table, the applicant identified that he was not able to bring lawyers and that he wanted justice.  Nothing said by the applicant identified any jurisdictional error.  The application fails to make out any jurisdictional error.  The application is dismissed. I certify that the preceding nineteen (19) paragraphs are a true copy of the reasons for judgment of Judge StreetAssociate:  Date: 7 December 2015       ',\n",
       " 'SZSYG v Minister for Immigration & Anor [2015] FCCA 1622 (19 June 2015)': \" Introduction  This is an application filed in this Court on 18 June 2013 under the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) (the “Migration Act”) seeking judicial review of a decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal (the “Tribunal”), being RRT Case Number 1300991, a decision of Tribunal Member S. Kamand dated 20 May 2013, affirming the decision of a delegate of the Minister for Immigration and Border Protection (the “Minister”) to refuse to grant the applicant a Protection (Class XA) visa. The solicitors for the Minister filed on 16 July 2013, pursuant to orders of the Court made on 5 July 2013, a folder which was indexed, labelled and paginated, containing all documents which may be relevant to the hearing. The volume of material provided has been identified as the Court Book (“CB”) and marked as Exhibit “A”.    The applicant was granted leave on 11 September 2013 to file and serve any amended application, affidavit evidence, written submissions or list of authorities upon which he sought to rely.  The applicant filed: The Affidavit of Nathan Hammond affirmed on 12 March 2014 and filed on the same day (the “Hammond Affidavit”); and Written submissions on 12 March 2014. Background  In setting out the following background material I have quoted directly from the Court Book and submissions prepared by the parties. I have not made further attribution as this would make the summary unwieldy. Where this information is extracted from the Court Book, each item contains a reference (“CB”) for that material. The applicant is a Sri Lankan national of Tamil ethnicity. He arrived on Christmas Island by boat on 29 May 2012 (CB 224 at [1]). As such he was an “irregular maritime arrival” and so was unable to apply for a Protection visa without a Ministerial dispensation pursuant to s.46A(2) of the Migration Act. In an entry interview conducted soon after his arrival he claimed that his father was abducted and killed before he was born. He also claimed that he had been abducted by a paramilitary group, questioned for an hour and released. He thought that those who abducted him suspected that he was supporting the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (“LTTE”) (CB 10). The Minister exercised his discretion to permit the applicant to lodge an application for a Protection visa on 22 September 2012 (CB 16). The application appears to have been lodged his application on that day (CB 17-73). In a statement attached to that application he claimed: That his father disappeared before he was born. He did not know who took his father or why; After his father’s disappearance his mother moved from Trincomalee to Chavakatchcheri, near Jaffna in the north of Sri Lanka. There she lived with her mother. The applicant was born in Chavakatchcheri on 24 October 1990; In 1990 his grandfather, who was a member of the Tamil National Alliance (“TNA”), a moderate Tamil group, was arrested by the Sri Lankan Army and held in “Poosa” (sic – Boosa) prison for three years on suspicion of links with the LTTE. He was tortured in prison; After his grandfather was released his mother and grandmother returned to Trincomalee because the Jaffna area was getting too dangerous; In 2007 a bomb exploded in a navy camp about 100 metres from the applicant’s home. When the applicant went to his gate to lock it a naval officer grabbed him, beat him on the head and held a gun to his head whilst swearing at him in Sinhalese. He was only released when his mother and grandmother grabbed the officer’s legs and pleaded with him; Following that incident the applicant obtained employment at a hotel near his house. On 21 February 2008 he was on his way to work when he heard his name being called. He walked towards the voices and was grabbed from behind, a hand was held against his mouth. His hands were tied and he was blindfolded and gagged. Something round and cool was put to his head. He believes that it was a gun. He was taken into the forest, abused in broken Tamil and accused of hiding weapons. He was released when villagers started calling out and searching for him; In about June 2008 he along with his uncle and about thirty others were detained in a round up. They were released after representations were made by the TNA leader; In 2010 the applicant started supporting the TNA and helped in their election campaigns in 2010 and 2011; and He decided to leave Sri Lanka because even though the war was over things were not improving for Tamils and he did not want to live in constant fear and die young like his father. He feared being detained by the Criminal Investigation Department (“CID”) upon return to Sri Lanka because of suspicion of support for the LTTE, because he was a returned asylum seeker and because of his support for the TNA and the rights of Tamils. Amongst the documents submitted in support of the application was a letter dated 24 July 2012 and signed by one K. Selvarajah, Chairman of the Urban Council of Trincomalee. Phone and fax numbers were given (CB 81). The letter identified the applicant, stated that he was an active supporter of Tamil political parties and had worked for the TNA in the 2010 and 2011 elections. The letter continued:  He has to flee Sri Lanka seeking asylum in a foreign country to save his life as he was threatened by unknown armed groups for engaging in politics in support of Tamils. The application was rejected on 2 January 2013 (CB 113-130). The delegate gave “little weight” to Mr Selvarajah’s letter because by the applicant’s own admission nothing had happened to him since 2008 and in his statement he said that he left because things were not improving for the Tamil people (CB 124.2).  Proceedings before the Tribunal  The application to the Tribunal was lodged on 22 January 2013 (CB 133-138). A hearing was scheduled for 2 May 2013 (CB 148) and a transcript of that hearing is annexed to the affidavit of Nathan Hammond made on 12 March 2014. The transcript indicates that there was discussion about Mr Selvarajah’s letter (Transcript (“T”) 33-34) but nothing was said as to whether Mr Selvarajah should be contacted to verify its contents. In a pre-hearing submission the applicant’s advisors made a claim on his behalf that one Puviraj, a TNA member had been kidnapped by the CID and tortured in January 2012.  This is footnoted to a folio in Departmental file CLF 2012/199660 (CB 164 at [47]). The submission also referred to reports that TNA representatives and supporters being threatened and attacked (CB 172-173). Further such reports were cited in a post hearing submission (CB 214-217).  The Tribunal’s decision  The Tribunal accepted the truth of the applicant’s claims as to being threatened and assaulted by a naval officer in 2007, being abducted and questioned about LTTE links in February 2008 and being held in a roundup in 2008 (CB 225-226 at [12]). It found however that he had no further direct experiences of harm between 2008 and when he left the country in 2012 during which time he worked, studied and travelled to the North-Central Province on public transport (CB 226-227 at [13]-[14]). It found that these facts threw significant doubt on his claims to have been of adverse interest to anyone and to have remained safe by living discreetly (CB 227 at [14]). It did accept, however, that the applicant had experienced a range of frightening events before June 2008, that he had grown up in the context of a bloody civil war and that he genuinely held fears for his safety (CB 227 at [15]). Having so found, the Tribunal accepted that the applicant was a supporter of the TNA but that he had exaggerated the nature and extent of his involvement. It was not satisfied that he campaigned door to door or street to street, gathered people in public places in support of the TNA or that he intended to be anything more than an ordinary Tamil civilian supporter of the TNA in the future. It was not satisfied that this level of support, even accumulated with other factors, would expose him to a real chance of harm in the future (CB 229 at [23]). In reaching this conclusion the Tribunal referred to the fact that it had put to the applicant that he had not raised an issue of fearing persecution for his support for the TNA at his arrival interview (CB 227 at [17] referring to T 32). It noted, at [17] (CB 227), that the applicant responded by referring to Mr Selvarajah’s letter (referring to T 32-33). The Tribunal commented in its decision that the circumstances in which the letter was provided raised doubts as to its veracity. It continued by stating at [17] (CB 227):  Further, the Tribunal is unable to contact the writer of the letter to test the veracity of its contents, as the Tribunal cannot be certain that the writer of that letter would be able to speak openly to the Tribunal or that the Tribunal’s inquiries would not open new risks of harm to the writer of the letter or the applicant. After observing that the applicant had indicated that his uncle had many connections to the TNA, it made a finding that the letter was not determinative of any of the applicant’s claims and nor did it overcome the Tribunal’s concerns as to the true nature and extent of his political involvement.  Having found that the applicant did not have a well-founded fear of persecution as a result of his opinions and activities in support of the TNA, the Tribunal discussed and dismissed his other claims on the basis of actual and imputed political opinion (CB 230-232), membership of a particular social group (CB 232-235), his illegal departure from Sri Lanka (CB 235-236), and his claims to complimentary protection (CB 236-237). Current Proceedings  The application to this Court seeks the following orders:  1. A writ of certiorari removing the decision into this Court to be quashed.  2. A writ of mandamus requiring the second respondent to rehear and redetermine the applicant’s application to it according to law.  3. Costs.  4. Any further or other relief as the Court considers appropriate. The sole ground of review pleaded in the application states:  1. The Tribunal denied the applicant natural justice in a manner not foreclosed by s.422B of the Migration Act.  Particulars  (a) Failure to disclose to the applicant the reasons why it considered that it could not make an enquiry of the author of a letter dated 24 July 2012 written by Mr K Selvaraja, who purported to be Chairman of the Urban Council of Trincomalee as to whether the applicant worked for the Tamil National alliance in the manner stated in that letter.  (b) Failure to make the enquiry stated in Particular (a) above. Applicant’s Submissions  The applicant had claimed in his Protection visa application that he feared persecution for supporting the TNA. The letter at CB 81 was potentially independent confirmation of the objective basis of that fear from a person who was in a position to know. It was therefore a very important document.  The applicant contends there is no question that the Tribunal considered the letter. There is also no doubt also that it considered contacting the author of the letter but decided against doing so because of concerns for the safety of the writer and the applicant, and uncertainty as to whether the writer would be able to speak freely. As stated above (at [11] above) the Tribunal did not raise with the applicant its concerns about contacting Mr Selvarajah.  Two questions arise from this: First, should it have done so pursuant to the common law requirement to act in a manner that was procedurally fair? Second, if so, did s.422B(1) of the Migration Act affect the requirements of procedural fairness in this case? The first question – the requirements of procedural fairness  Natural justice or procedural fairness requires that there be a fair decision making process, not a fair result. It entails a flexible obligation to act fairly in a manner appropriate and adapted to the facts of the individual case (e.g. Kioa v West [1985] HCA 81;  (1986) 159 CLR 550 at 584-585; 612-615). Often this obligation is satisfied by disclosure of the issues in a case, by the disclosure of adverse material or information for comment, and by the tribunal of fact acting in a way that precludes a reasonable apprehension of bias.  There are however other requirements, such as addressing a clearly articulated submission or claim (e.g. Dranichnikov v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (2003) 197 ALR 389 at [24], [95]), and the requirement to consider evidence which has the potential to be decisive (e.g. MZYGC v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship  [2010] FCA 966 at  [11] per Jessup J).  Thus the requirements of natural justice are not to be reduced to inflexible categories. The circumstances of this case are that the Tribunal member who considered all the evidence and conducted a thorough hearing thought about contacting Mr Selvarajah about what was written in his letter. She did not do so because of concerns about influences on any response that she may obtain, and a concern of placing Mr Selvarajah and the applicant in danger. Those concerns were no doubt based on her perception of the situation in Sri Lanka. But as the letter was of great potential importance – in fact so important that she thought about making contact with the author – it could only have been procedurally fair to put her concerns to the applicant. It may be that he or his advisor could have given information about the author and his office which allayed her fears, or persuaded her of a way to make the enquiry in a manner which allayed her concerns. The Tribunal’s failure to disclose to the applicant the reasons why it considered that it could not make an enquiry of Mr Selvarajah potentially deprived it of a line of inquiry that could have affected the outcome of the case. The applicant contends the Tribunal’s failure to put its concerns about contacting Mr Selvarajah for his comment breached the requirements of procedural fairness.The second question – the effect of s. 422B  Section 422B of the Migration Act states:  422B Exhaustive statement of natural justice hearing rule   (1) This Division is taken to be an exhaustive statement of the requirements of the natural justice hearing rule in relation to the matters it deals with.   (2) Sections 416, 437 and 438 and Division 7A, in so far as they relate to this Division, are taken to be an exhaustive statement of the requirements of the natural justice hearing rule in relation to the matters they deal with.   (3) In applying this Division, the Tribunal must act in a way that is fair and just. In Saeed v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2010] HCA 23;  (2010) 241 CLR 252 the plurality of the High Court held that the matters “it [i.e. the Division in question] deals with” in s. 51A (an analogue to s.357A and s.422B) required a search of the sections within the Division for a provision ‘dealing with’ a relevant “matter” (at [39]). Inquiries by the Refugee Review Tribunal are dealt with by ss.424(1) and s. 427(1)(d). Those provisions permit the Tribunal a discretion to make inquiries. However, the way the discretion is to be exercised is not the subject of any provision within Division 4 of Part 7 of the Migration Act. Thus natural justice applies. In addition, in Minister for Immigration and Citizenship v Li & Anor [2013] HCA 18;  (2013) 249 CLR 332 the Hayne, Kiefel and Bell JJ discussed the meaning and application of s.357A(3), which has an analogue in s.422B(3). Without coming to a concluded view on the issue of what s.357A(3) requires (at [62]) their Honours suggested, at [57]-[58] that a breach of the requirement to act in a way that is fair and just is to be ascertained by reading it as it applies to the Tribunal in the conduct of its review. Whether or not s.357A(3) incorporates the requirements of procedural fairness it is clear that no provision of Division 4 of Part 7 of the Migration Act governed the procedures by which the Tribunal was to decide whether to make an inquiry. Section 422B(1) did not excuse the Tribunal from acting in a way that was procedurally fair. In those circumstances the Tribunal’s failure to advise the applicant for his comment the reasons why it did not contact Mr Selvarajah was a breach of the requirements of procedural fairness and thus a jurisdictional error. Ground 1(b) of the application is not pressed by the applicant. Minister’s Submissions  The sole ground of review in the application relates to the following passage in its decision record at [17] (CB 227) (bold added):  [The Applicant] responded by reference to a letter in support from a person from Trincomalee Urban Council ..., insisting that this evidences his support and involvement with the TNA.  However the letter is dated 24 July 2012, and according to the applicant, was emailed to him in Australia after he heard that he needs documentary evidence in support of his Protection visa application.  That the letter was provided with his Protection visa application in mind raises concerns that its contents were drafted to enhance the applicant’s claims. Further, the Tribunal is unable to contact the writer of the letter to test the veracity of its contents, as the Tribunal cannot be certain that the writer of that letter would be able to speak openly to the Tribunal or that the Tribunal’s inquiries would not open new risks of harm to the writer of the letter or the applicant.  Further, the applicant has indicated that his uncle has many connections in the TNA which suggests that such a letter may not be difficult to source.  For the above reasons cumulatively, the Tribunal does not consider the letter... to be determinative of any aspect of the applicant’s claims or to overcome the Tribunal’s concerns regarding the true nature and extent of his political involvement in Sri Lanka.  The Minister submits it is clear that in the bolded portion the Tribunal was considering whether to use its powers in s.424 to “get any information that it considers relevant”.  In general, the Tribunal is not obliged to exercise these inquisitorial powers:  WAEH of 2002 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2002] FCAFC 364 at  [19]- [24] (Wilcox, RD Nicholson and Downes JJ); Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v SGLB [2004] HCA 32;  (2004) 207 ALR 12 at  [43] (Gummow and Hayne JJ).  This was not a case where the “limited” duty to inquire applied: see Minister for Immigration and Citizenship v SZIAI & Anor [2009] HCA 39;  (2009) 259 ALR 429.   Despite what the applicant submits ([21]-[32] above), there was no obligation on the Tribunal to give the applicant a hearing on whether it would use its inquisitorial powers.  The applicant has cited no authority for such an obligation regarding the decision to use the Tribunal’s inquisitorial powers.  In any case, there appears to have been no request by the applicant that the Tribunal do so.  The idea of contacting the author of the letter appears to have been the Tribunal’s own, which it briefly considered and then rejected.  It was under no obligation to consult the applicant in this decision.   Consideration  Having regard to the above submissions, I am not satisfied the claim advanced by the applicant can be sustained.  The relevant passage that is the subject of the applicant’s claim has been reproduced above at [34].  The Tribunal was considering whether it should use its inquisitorial powers to contact the writer of a letter in Sri Lanka that had been written in support of the application’s protection claims.  It ultimately declined to do so, on the basis that it would not be able to know if the writer would be able to speak openly to the Tribunal and on the basis that the Tribunal’s inquiries might open new risks of harm to the applicant and/or the writer. In WAEH of 2002 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (supra), the Full Court stated at [19]-[22]:  Failure to consider exercise of powers pursuant to s424 of the Act  19. S424 provides powers to the Tribunal by which it may seek additional information. Before the primary judge a similar ground was argued also with reference to s427 which gives to a tribunal powers to summon or require evidence. The second ground of appeal for which leave was given is expressed only with reference to s424.  20. Prior authorities in relation to the powers under s424 were considered by the primary judge. He stated that had it have been necessary he would have followed the line of authority commencing with Kulwant Singh to the effect that the section is permissive and does not require the power to be exercised. That line of authority, as he pointed out, was contrary to the decision of Madgwick J at first instance in Al Shamry where his Honour held that it could be inferred from the silence of a tribunal in relation to the issue of why investigative avenues had not been pursued that it gave no consideration to the question whether any such clarificatory exercise of its information-gathering powers was necessary and that, in the circumstances, there was a breach of the Tribunal's obligations under the Act. The primary judge considered it was unnecessary for him in the present matter to form a definite view on this issue. He considered the Tribunal's clear finding that even if the appellant was a leader in the League, he did not have a well-founded fear of persecution, was conclusive so that the Tribunal had not been obliged to consider whether to exercise the investigative powers conferred on it by either s424 or s427.  21. Counsel for the appellant argued that the authorities referred to by his Honour were ones in which the decisions had been made as to whether the failure to consider gave rise to a procedural breach pursuant to s476(1)(a) of the Act. The issue was further addressed in that light in Yusuf v Minister for Immigration & Multicultural Affairs [1999] FCA 1053;  [1999] 58 ALD 470 and in Marjeed. Here, however, the argument is based on failure to consider a relevant consideration namely, whether the Tribunal should exercise such powers.  22. Our views accord with submissions on behalf of the respondent on this ground which must be accepted for the following reasons. The first is that the statute does not impose an implied obligation to consider the exercise of the power. That much is common ground and it is significant. The second is that the issue relied upon in the ground is not a relevant consideration: Minister for Aboriginal Affairs v Peko-Wallsend  (1986) 162 CLR 27 at 39 per Mason J. A relevant consideration arises where an implication arises to that effect from the subject matter, scope and purpose of the Act. It is just that obligation which it is common ground does not exist under s424. The third is that s476(3)(e) provides that a failure to take a relevant consideration into account in the exercise of a power is not included in the reference to an improper exercise of power in s476(1)(d). As stated in WAEH (supra), the statute does not impose an implied obligation on the Tribunal to consider the exercise of its power under s.424.  This is, importantly, accepted by the applicant.  The Tribunal considered whether it would use its power, but declined to (and gave reasons. Further, as correctly submitted by the Minister (though not strictly pleaded by the applicant), this was not a case where the “limited” duty to inquire applied: see Minister for Immigration and Citizenship v SZIAI (supra).  This was not pleaded by the applicant and, on a fair reading of the relevant part of the Decision Record, it cannot be said that such an obligation arose. The last aspect of the applicant’s claim alleges the Tribunal breached its procedural fairness obligations to the applicant by not inviting him to comment on (or invite him to a further hearing) the Tribunal’s decision not to contact the writer of the letter. In SZBEL v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] HCA 63;  (2006) 228 CLR 152, the High Court stated at [48]:  48. Secondly, as Lord Diplock said in F Hoffmann-La Roche & Co AG v Secretary of State for Trade and Industry:   ... the rules of natural justice do not require the decision maker to disclose what he is minded to decide so that the parties may have a further opportunity of criticising his mental processes before he reaches a final decision. If this were a rule of natural justice only the most talkative of judges would satisfy it and trial by jury would have to be abolished.  Procedural fairness does not require the tribunal to give an applicant a running commentary upon what it thinks about the evidence that is given. On the contrary, to adopt such a course would be likely to run a serious risk of conveying an impression of prejudgment. I accept the Minister’s submissions that the contention that there is no obligation to consult an applicant about whether or not the Tribunal is going its powers under s.424(1) in circumstances where the applicant did not ask the Tribunal to contact the letter’s writer.  If the Tribunal were obliged to consult the applicant, this would undermine the s.430 obligation to give reasons.  Further, the authority of Li (supra) concerned a situation where an applicant expressly asked for an adjournment that was refused with very brief reasons.   Accordingly, the sole ground of review pleaded by the applicant cannot be sustained and should be dismissed. The “WZAPN” Issue  This matter came before the Court for hearing on 3 December 2014.  Judgment was reserved.  Consequently, as other proceedings addressing this specific issue had requested the reserved judgment not be finalised until the High Court decision was known, I have adopted that approach for this current matter. On 3 September 2014, the Federal Court of Australia delivered judgment in the matter WZAPN v Minister for Immigration and Border Protection  [2014] FCA 947 per North J. On 1 October 2014, the Minister filed in the High Court of Australia an Application for Special Leave to Appeal from the judgment of North J in WZAPN (supra). Failed Protection visa applicants of Tamil ethnicity returning to Sri Lanka voluntarily or by escort on temporary travel documents from a Western country will be questioned by the authorities and may be arrested and held on remand for a few days whilst waiting for a court appearance facing charges including possible breaches of the Immigration and Emigration Act 1949. Various country reports together with a Sydney Morning Herald article of 8-9 December 2012 indicate that people are detained possibly for 3 days after which they are bailed for a future court appearance.  The hearing may levy a fine based on a law of general application relating to illegal departure from Sri Lanka.  Country information indicates that there is some evidence demonstrating that the law is discriminatorily applied to people of Tamil ethnicity.  As the entry point is usually Colombo, remand would be served in Negombo Prison which is cramped and unsanitary.  The question arises as to whether being questioned, detained for up to 3 days and significant fines are of the type and seriousness of harm amounting to persecution as meant by s.91R of the Migration Act.  In WZAPN (supra), North J held that the application of s.91R did not permit a quantitative assessment of the nature of the harm required to be considered by that section.   His Honour described the approach taken by the Reviewer at [18], where he states:   18. The reviewer accepted that there was a real chance that the applicant would be questioned periodically and probably detained for short periods when he failed to provide identification, but held that the frequency and length of the detention, and the nature of the treatment he would receive in detention, did not amount to serious harm within s 91R(2)(a), (b) or (c). The reviewer concluded that on this analysis, the nature of the detention was not sufficiently significant and thus did not constitute serious harm ... In approaching the matter in this way, the reviewer made a qualitative assessment of the nature of the harm caused by the detention. The argument was recorded by his Honour as:  20.  The applicant contended in his original written submissions, and in oral submissions, that the reviewer wrongly applied a qualitative assessment to the nature of the harm. The applicant argued that s 91R(2)(a) is concerned with the threat, in the sense of a risk, of harm to life and liberty, whatever the nature of the harm. Whether there is a threat depends on an assessment of the likelihood of harm happening. But once that threat is established, s 91R(2)(a) operates so that the threat to life or liberty amounts to serious harm irrespective of the nature or extent of the potential harm to life or liberty. Thus, there is no place for an assessment of the frequency or degree of the harm, or the circumstances which attend such harm, save only for a de minimus exclusion. Consequently, once the reviewer found that the applicant was at risk of detention, serious harm was established within the meaning of s 91R(2)(a) irrespective of the significance of the circumstances attending the detention. That argument was accepted by his Honour at [30], [44] and [45] where his Honour stated:  30. The conclusion from the language and structure of s 91R(2) is that serious harm in s 91R(1)(b) is constituted by a threat to life or liberty, without reference to the severity of the consequences to life or liberty.   ...  44. In taking the human rights approach, there is no place for a qualitative assessment of detention affecting the right to liberty for it to constitute an infringement of that right.  45. By making a qualitative assessment of the nature and degree of the harm experienced by the applicant when asking whether the threat to the applicant’s liberty was sufficiently significant, the reviewer in the present case applied the wrong test in the application of s 91R(2)(a), and thereby fell into jurisdictional error. North J’s decision in WZAPN v Minister for Immigration and Border Protection (supra) has been considered in the following Full Federal Court decisions; SZTEQ v Minister for Immigration and Border Protection  [2015] FCAFC 39 per Robertson, Griffiths and Mortimer JJ; BZAFM v Minister for Immigration and Border Protection  [2015] FCAFC 41 per Robertson, Griffith and Mortimer JJ; and SZTIB v Minister for Immigration and Border Protection [2015] FCAFC 40 per Robertson, Griffith and Mortimer JJ. After a detailed consideration of the approach of the construction of s.91R and to the test in s.91R(1) and (2) their Honours found in SZTEQ at [58]-[60]:    58. Another aspect of the structure of s 91R(1), which we have touched on above, concerns the fact that it contains three separate and cumulative conditions for persecution to be established for the purposes of the Migration Act and the regulations, of which the requirement of serious harm is only one. We acknowledge that matters such as the length of detention, its frequency, purpose and character may also arise in determining whether the reason for the detention, which must be a Convention reason, is the essential and significant reason for the persecution (as required by s 91R(1)(a)) or involves systematic and discriminatory conduct (as required by s 91R(1)(c)). However, this does not mean that such matters may not also arise for consideration and evaluation in relation to the requirement of serious harm within s 91R(1)(b).  59.  Unlike North J in WZAPN, we do not consider the absence of adjectival qualification in s 91R(2)(a) to be of significance, given the context of the provision as a whole. Rather, the absence of an adjective indicates that a threat to “liberty“ is not synonymous with the possibility of a person being held briefly on remand or detained for a short time for questioning. In this context, “liberty“ is a nuanced concept which takes its meaning from the context in which it appears, namely the requirement that the persecution involve serious harm, as is made clear in s 91R(1).  60.  With great respect to the different view expressed in WZAPN at [30], we do not consider that the structure of s 91R(2) supports a construction of that provision to the effect that any threat to liberty constitutes serious harm without reference to the severity of the threat to liberty. As Dixon CJ observed in a frequently cited passage in Commissioner for Railways (NSW) v Agalianos  [1955] HCA 27 ;  (1955) 92 CLR 390 at 397:  ... the general purpose and policy of a provision and its consistency and fairness are surer guides to its meaning than the logic with which it is constructed. In the conclusion of SZTEQ at [154]-[155], their Honours state:  154.  For the above reasons, and with great respect to North J, we do not consider that WZAPN correctly decided the construction of s 91R(2)(a). In our opinion, s 91R(2)(a) should not be construed as meaning that any deprivation of liberty constitutes serious harm for the purposes of s 91R(1)(b) and Art 1A(2).  155. As the above analysis has sought to show, even if there was no error in his Honour’s examination of ss 91R(1) and (2) and the Convention concept of persecution by reference to “international human rights standards“ (see his Honour’s reasons at [43]), an issue which need not be determined in this appeal, contrary to his Honour’s reasoning, neither those standards, nor the jurisprudence and commentary about those standards in refugee decision-making supports the proposition that any deprivation of liberty must constitute serious harm for the purpose of the Convention. On 17 June 2015 the High Court unanimously allowed an appeal from the Federal Court: see Minister for Immigration and Border Protection v WZAPN & Anor  [2015] HCA 22.  It also unanimously dismissed an appeal from the Federal Court which was WZARV v Minister for Immigration and Border Protection (2014) 144 ALD 82.  The High Court held that the likelihood of a period of temporary detention of a person for a reason mentioned in the Refugees Convention is not, of itself and without more, a threat to liberty within the meaning of s.91R(2)(a) of the Migration Act.  Conclusion  I have read the contents of the Court Book and, particularly, the Decision Record. On a fair reading thereof, no jurisdictional error on the part of the Tribunal is apparent. Accordingly, as the pleaded ground in the application or submissions made by the applicant cannot be sustained, the application should be dismissed with costs awarded to the Minister.I certify that the preceding fifty-five (55) paragraphs are a true copy of the reasons for judgment of Judge Lloyd-JonesAssociate:  Date:  19 June 2015       \",\n",
       " 'SZTCV v Minister for Immigration & Anor [2015] FCCA 1677 (19 June 2015)': ' Introduction  This is an application filed in this Court on 25 July 2013 under the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) (the “Migration Act”) seeking judicial review of a decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal (the “Tribunal”), being RRT Case Number 1300991, a decision of Tribunal Member P. McIntosh dated 26 June 2013, affirming the decision of a delegate of the Minister for Immigration and Border Protection (the “Minister”) to refuse to grant the applicant a Protection (Class XA) visa. The solicitors for the Minister filed on 2 September 2013 a folder which was indexed, labelled and paginated, containing all documents which may be relevant to the hearing. The volume of material provided has been identified as the Court Book (“CB”) and marked as Exhibit “A”.    The applicant was granted leave on 11 September 2013 to file and serve any amended application, affidavit evidence, written submissions or list of authorities upon which he sought to rely.  The applicant filed: An amended application on 27 September 2013; and A further amended application on 30 May 2014.  No leave was granted for the filing of the further amended application and the Minister opposed the granting of such leave.  This is addressed below. Background  In setting out the following background material I have quoted directly from the Court Book and submissions prepared by the parties. I have not made further attribution as this would make the summary unwieldy. Where this information is extracted from the Court Book, each item contains a reference (“CB”) for that material. The applicant is a citizen of Sri Lanka who arrived on Christmas Island on 20 June 2012 (CB 85.3).  On 18 September 2012 the applicant was informed that the Minister had exercised his power under s.46A(2) of the Migration Act to allow the applicant to apply for a protection visa (CB 5).  The applicant applied for the visa on 18 September 2012 (CB 1-61).  The delegate refused the visa on 13 February 2013 (CB 80-101).  The applicant applied to the Tribunal for review on 20 February 2013 (CB 102-177).  The Tribunal held a hearing on 12 April 2013 (CB 203-205). The applicant claimed to fear persecution in Sri Lanka because of his Tamil ethnicity and suspected involvement with the LTTE.  He claimed to have been born in 1995 in Mallaithivu, a LTTE stronghold during the civil war.  He claimed that he was stopped and searched by soldiers on his way to school during the civil war, and that in 2010 and 2011 soldiers had visited his home and registered the occupants.  He claimed that in 2012 men in plainclothes visited his house and questioned the occupants.  He claimed that he was not mistreated, but was frightened and left Sri Lanka with a stepbrother in June 2012 (CB 219-222 at [23]-[47]).  The Tribunal found that the applicant was not of any particular interest to the authorities, and rejected his claims to fear harm as a member of an alleged particular social group of “failed asylum seekers” (CB 223-225 [48]-[61]). The Tribunal also considered the possibility that the applicant might be charged with illegal departure from Sri Lanka.  The Tribunal found that while it was possible that the Applicant might be detained for up to three nights in “cramped and unpleasant circumstances” before being bailed, this would not amount to systematic and discriminatory conduct within s.91R(1)(c) of the Migration Act (CB 226 at [64]), or be “significant harm” within the “complementary protection” provisions in s.36(2)(aa) of the Act (CB 226-227 at [69]-[73]). Current Proceedings  Leave was sought at the final hearing by the applicant to file a further amended application, which was opposed by the Minister.  Notwithstanding, the Minister’s representatives had prepared submissions to address the added ground proposed to be relied upon by the applicant.  Accordingly, leave was granted for the filing of the further amended application. The further amended application pleads the following grounds of review:  1. The RRT erred in its understanding of the applicable law on what was degrading treatment or punishment and cruel or inhuman treatment or punishment.  It accordingly failed to address the correct test when it made a finding on whether the treatment that applicant would face on being detained in Sri Lanka was degrading treatment or punishment or was cruel or inhuman treatment or punishment.  2. The RRT failed to comply with Ministerial Direction Number 56 in contravention of s.499(2A) of the Migration Act 1958.  Particulars  The RRT failed to take into account the PAM 3 Protection Visas complimentary protection guidelines when it made a finding on whether the treatment that applicant would face on being detained in Sri Lanka was degrading treatment or punishment or was cruel or inhuman treatment or punishment.  3. The RRT failed to take into account a relevant consideration.  Particulars  The applicant repeats the same particulars to ground 2.  4. The RRT failed to address a claim of fear of persecution for imputed political opinion.  Particulars  The RRT did not address the claim that he would be imputed to be a supporter of ProTamil political parties because the applicant’s family was Applicant’s Submissions  The applicant contends that the Tribunal’s findings as to complimentary protection are infected with jurisdictional error. The applicant seeks the leave of the Court to file a further amended application in the form annexed to these submissions. The applicant made claims that he feared significant harm in Sri Lanka as a returning failed Tamil asylum seeker. He claimed he would face incarceration on his return. The applicant’s adviser submitted reports as to the overcrowding and lack of sanitation in the Sri Lankan prison system generally.  This included the following from a  UNCAT report (CB 198):   Prison conditions were poor and did not meet international standards due to overcrowding and the lack of sanitary facilities.  In many cases prisoners reportedly slept out out on concrete floors and often lacked natural light or sufficient ventilation.  According to prison officials and civil society sources prisons designed for approximately 11,000 inmates held an estimated 32,000 prisoners.  More than 11,000 of these prisoners were awaiting or undergoing trial....Pre-trial detainees were often not held separately from those convicted....Authorities acknowledged poor prison conditions but noted a lack of space and resources as determining factors. The material before the Tribunal also contained accounts given by asylum seekers returned by Australia. One account was of returnees held on remand in Negombo prison:  They put us with the murderers and the drug addicts” Mr Suresh said “We slept on the floor in line, our bodies pressed up against each other.  We could not roll over.” In another cell another asylum seeker Balan said “Some nights, we had to take turns sleeping because there was no space.  One would sit up while the other slept on the ground.  If you had money you could pay a bribe to get more space.(CB 226)  The Tribunal accepted that there were substantial grounds for believing there is a real risk that the applicant would be detained in prison on return for up to several nights because of his illegal departure (CB 208 at [91]).  The Tribunal accepted that the conditions in Negombo prison for previous detainees was very cramped and that they were accommodated with people they perceived to be “murderers” and “drug addicts”.  The Tribunal accepted that these circumstances would be experienced by the applicant as disturbing and very unpleasant (CB 227 at [70]). The applicant’s adviser submitted that the treatment that the applicant was likely to face in detention on return to Sri Lanka would be both “cruel or inhuman treatment or punishment” and “degrading treatment or punishment” causing or intending to cause “extreme humiliation” (CB 202). The Tribunal addressed this submission as follows:  I have also considered whether the applicant, by being detained and during his brief detention might be subjected to cruel or inhuman treatment or punishment.  As noted above cruel or inhuman treatment or punishment is defined to mean an act or omission by which severe pain or suffering, whether physical or mental, is intentionally inflicted on a person, or pain or suffering, whether physical or mental, is intentionally inflicted on a person, so long as, in all the circumstances, the act or omission could reasonably be regarded as cruel or inhuman in nature.  degrading treatment or punishment is defined to mean an act or omission which causes, or is intended to cause, extreme humiliation which is unreasonable.  On the limited available evidence I am not satisfied that his treatment would involve a level of pain or suffering which could reasonably be regarded as “cruel or inhuman in nature”.  For the same reasons, while I accept that the circumstances while detained may be experienced by him as degrading, the evidence does not indicate, and I am not satisfied, that they would be intended to cause “extreme humiliation which is unreasonable”.(CB 227 at [71]-[72]) Jurisdictional Error  It is submitted that the Tribunal misunderstood what could “reasonably” be regarded as “cruel or inhuman treatment or punishment” or “degrading treatment or punishment” within the meaning of those terms as defined in s.5(1) of the Migration Act.  The expression “significant harm” is defined by s.36(2A) of the Migration Act to refer to five categories of harm, which relevantly for the purposes of this case include: degrading treatment or punishment and cruel or inhuman treatment or punishment.  Section 5(1) of the Migration Act defines the expressions:   Degrading treatment or punishment   “an act or omission that causes, and is intended to cause, extreme humiliation which is unreasonable, but does not include an act or omission:  (a) that is not inconsistent with Article 7 of the Covenant; or   (b) that causes, and is intended to cause, extreme humiliation arising only from, inherent in or incidental to, lawful sanctions that are not inconsistent with the Articles of the Covenant.”  Cruel or inhuman treatment or punishment   an act or omission by which   (a)  severe pain or suffering, whether physical or mental, is intentionally inflicted on a person; or (b)  pain or suffering, whether physical or mental, is intentionally inflicted on a person so long as, in all the circumstances, the act or omission could reasonably be regarded as cruel or inhuman in nature;  but does not include an act or omission:  (a)  that is not inconsistent with Article 7 of the Covenant; or  (b)  arising only from, inherent in or incidental to, lawful sanctions that are not inconsistent with the Articles of the Covenant. The statutory definition of cruel and inhuman treatment and punishment is informed by Australia’s international obligations under the CAT and the ICCPR (see SZSYP v Minister for Immigration & Anor  [2014] FCCA 7 at  [15-[19]). The content of those obligations is in turn informed by the decisions of the Human Rights Committee established under the ICCPR (see Minister for Immigration and Citizenship v Anochie  [2012] FCA 1440 at  [40]- [50]).  This is explicitly accepted in the PAM 3 complimentary protection guidelines (see Anochie (supra) at [22], [25]) which the Tribunal has been directed by the Minister to take into account (Direction 54 made under s.499 of the Migration Act and with which the Tribunal is required to comply by s.499(2A) of the Migration Act). Decisions of the Human Rights Committee have accepted that detention with convicted criminals in extremely cramped and unsanitary conditions, even for a short period of time, can constitute both cruel or inhuman treatment and punishment, as well as degrading treatment or punishment.  For example in Portorreal v Dominican Republic Comm No 188/1984, UN Doc CCPR/C/OP/2 (5 November 1987), the author “was arrested...taken to a cell  at the secret service police headquarters from where he was transferred to another cell measuring 20 by 5 metres where approximately 125 persons accused of common crimes were being held, and where, owing to lack of space, some detainees had to sit on excrement. He received no food or water until the following day.  On 16 June 1984, after 50 hours of detention, he was released.  At no time during his detention was he informed of the reasons for his arrest.”  The Human rights Committee found that author’s treatment during his 50 hours of detention amounted to both inhuman and degrading treatment (Portorreal (supra) at [11]). Decisions by the Human Rights Committee and examples given in the PAM 3 Guidelines demonstrate that poor prison conditions  which can amount to cruel or inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, include, inter alia, overcrowding; unsanitary conditions; exposure to cold (Human Rights Committee Conteras v Uruguay, Comm No 1139/1983,  UN Doc Supp. No 40 A40/40 [17 July 1985]); inadequate ventilation or lighting (Human Rights Committee Brown v Jamaica, Comm No 775/1997, UN Doc CCPR/C/65/D/775/1997 (23 March 1999)); inadequate bedding, inadequate clothing, inadequate nutrition and clean drinking water, lack of opportunity for adequate exercise (Human Rights Committee Mukong v Cameroon, Comm no 458/1991, UN Doc CCPR/C/51/D/458/1991 (21 July 1994); Mika Miha v Equatorial Guinea, Comm No 414/1990 UN Doc CCPR/C/51/D/414/1990 (8 July 1994)); and denial of medical treatment (Human Rights Committee Brown v Jamaica, Comm No 775/1997, UN Doc CCPR/C/65/D/775/1997 (23 March 1999)). The Tribunal accepted the conditions on remand in Negombo prison were overcrowded and unsanitary as described in the report by Ben Doherty in the Sydney Morning Herald on 8 December 2012 (CB 226).  The conditions described in that report included that: remand prisoners shared their cells with convicted murderers and drug offenders; the space in the cell was such that the prisoners had to sleep on the floor in line with their bodies pressed against each other so they could not roll over; and in another cell there was not even enough room for all the prisoners to lie down, and some had to sit up; These conditions were of the sort found by the Human Rights Committee to be both inhuman and degrading treatment. No reference was made by the Tribunal to the fact that the PAM 3 guidelines instructed the Tribunal to have regard to international jurisprudence in construing those terms.  No reference was made by the Tribunal to the various examples of relevant international jurisprudence that were extracted in the PAM 3 guidelines.    The Tribunal made no attempt to grapple with the issues of how the prison conditions of Negombo prison, as described in the Sydney Morning Herald article, were distinguishable from those found by the Human Rights Committee to amount to degrading treatment or punishment. It is quite clear that the type of prison conditions the Tribunal accepted that the applicant would endure, even for a short period of time, were capable of being reasonably regarded as “degrading treatment or punishment” and “cruel or inhuman treatment or punishment” within the meaning of s5(1) of the Migration Act as exemplified by international jurisprudence.   The failure of the Tribunal to refer to this jurisprudence or the relevant parts of the PAM 3 guidelines indicates that the Tribunal misunderstood the applicable law.  The Tribunal’s application of the definition to the facts before it could not have been conducted according to law -because it misunderstood the applicable law.   Further, the failure of the Tribunal to either specifically acknowledge or otherwise demonstrate awareness of the direction in the PAM 3 guidelines that it interpret this part of the definition by reference to the international jurisprudence and to refer to the international jurisprudence considering when treatment would constitute degrading treatment or punishment in breach of Article 7 of the ICCPR demonstrates that the Tribunal did not, in substance, “take into account”  those guidelines as required by  Direction 56 (see WZAQU v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship  [2013] FCA 327 at  [12]; Minister for Immigration and Border Protection v MZYTS  [2013] FCAFC 114 at  [39]).  This in turn meant that the Tribunal failed to take into account relevant considerations and failed to comply with section 499(2A) of the Migration Act which was a jurisdictional error (see for example Spruill v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2012] FCA 1401;  (2012) 135 ALD 45, Nweke v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2012] FCA 266;  (2012) 126 ALD 501, Lesianawai v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2012] FCA 897;  (2012) 131 ALD 27, Tauariki v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2012] FCA 1408;  (2012) 135 ALD 51). Relief should be given in the terms sought in the application. At the hearing of this matter on 30 May 2014 the Court granted leave for the applicant to provide written submissions on the fourth ground in the further amended application. That ground is that the Tribunal failed to address a claim of fear of persecution for imputed political opinion as a supporter of Pro-Tamil political parties. Submission on Substance  The claim was made on behalf of the applicant by the applicant’s adviser in her submissions to the delegate of 5 October 2012. The claim is set out on page 76 of Exhibit A1 in the fifth dot point under the heading “Why would Mr [S] be at risk on return to Sri Lanka?”. The imputation was claimed to arise because the applicant’s family had a history of supporting pro Tamil parties.  His step father was imprisoned and tortured in the past because of his involvement with the EPDP and his uncle has also stood for election in 2010 for the Tamil National Alliance (“TNA”) and his step brother helped him campaign. It is submitted that it is unambiguously a claim of fear of persecution for imputed political opinion which is distinct to that of being an imputed LTTE supporter.  The claim is made separately from the fear of persecution for an imputed political opinion as an LTTE supporter (which is the claim made in the third dot point on the same page).  It is submitted that it is a claim that is clearly articulated.  It arose squarely for consideration. In the adviser’s submission to the Tribunal at CB 192 the imputed political opinion claim is again stated as having 2 aspects “suspected LTTE links” and “an opponent of the ruling party” (second dot point under the heading claims). It is well established that a failure by the Tribunal to consider a claim which, if sustained, might lead to a finding in the applicant’s favour, will be a failure to complete the exercise of the Tribunal’s jurisdiction and a jurisdictional error (see Htun v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (2001) 194 ALR 244).  This claim has these attributes.  There is no reference to the claim in the Tribunal’s decision.  The Tribunal characterises the applicant’s imputed political opinion claim as being wholly attributable to imputed LTTE support.  At CB 219 Tribunal at [18] characterises the applicant’s claim as fearing persecution for being imputed with a political opinion relating to links with the LTTE.  The Tribunal was satisfied that the applicant’s credibility was not an issue in the matter (CB p.217).  The claim was thus not impliedly disposed of by adverse credit findings.  These are the applicant’s submissions on the substance of the ground.   Leave   It is submitted that ground 4 in the further amended application is meritorious.  Ground 4 is a succinct ground and can be determined on the material that has been admitted into evidence. The consequences for the applicant of leave not being granted to raise the new ground are potentially very serious (should the other grounds raised by him not find favour with the Court).  The stakes are very high (see NAJT v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCAFC 134;  (2005) 147 FCR 51 at  [50] per Madgwick J (Conti J agreeing). It is in the interests of justice that the Court ensure that the Tribunal’s consideration of the applicant’s application be lawfully completed. It is in the interests of justice that the case for the applicant be considered in its entirety before this Court, rather than having the prospect of a further ground being raised for consideration on any appeal without having been considered at first instance.  This promotes the efficiency of the appeal process (see NAJT (supra) at [169]). The prejudice which the respondent pointed to was the inadequate opportunity he had to respond to the ground, it having been raised the day prior to the hearing. That prejudice has been addressed by the opportunity to provide written submissions. Minister’s Submissions  The proposed further amended application contains three grounds, all concerning the Tribunal’s complementary protection findings. The first ground claims that the Tribunal “erred in its understanding on what was degrading treatment or punishment and cruel or inhuman treatment or punishment”, but does not indicate how the Tribunal is said to have so erred.  The applicant’s submissions complain that the Tribunal did not refer to international authorities, especially decisions of the United Nations Human Rights Committee concerning prison conditions, albeit not those in Sri Lanka.  However as pointed out in Minister for Immigration and Citizenship v MZYYL [2012] FCAFC 147;  (2012) 207 FCR 211 at  [18]- [20] the complementary protection provisions are a code and use language different from those contained in international human rights treaties.  The Tribunal correctly applied the terms of the legislation, consistently with MZYYL (supra) at [20]; see similarly SZSPE v Minister for Immigration and Border Protection [2014] FCA 267 per Yates J at [40]-[43].  The Minister submits this ground fails. Ground two claims that the Tribunal failed to apply the PAM 3 Complementary Protection Guidelines, as required by Direction 56 made under s.499 of the Migration Act.  The Tribunal notes at [11] (CB 218) that it is bound by the Direction and states that it has taken the PAM 3 Complementary Protection guidelines into account to the extent that they are relevant.  That is all that clause 2 of Direction 56 requires.  Contrary to the applicant’s submissions, the PAM 3 guidelines do not require the Tribunal to engage in some explicit consideration of possibly relevant international authorities in every case.  Firstly, the Direction cannot be inconsistent with the Migration Act: s.499(2), so the construction of the complementary protection provisions in MZYYL (supra) and SZSPE (supra) cannot have been altered by the Direction.  And secondly, the decisions of the Human Rights Committee cited in the Applicant’s submissions do not concern Sri Lanka and at most indicate that prison conditions may breach provisions of international human rights treaties.  The Tribunal nowhere denies that it is possible that prison conditions in Sri Lanka could amount to “significant harm” as defined in ss.5(1) and 36(2A) of the Migration Act, so there is nothing in its reasoning inconsistent with the decisions cited in the applicant’s submissions.  Rather the Tribunal at [69]-[73] (CB 226-227) has not been satisfied on the evidence before it that the conditions which there was a real chance that the Applicant might experience in detention could be said to be sufficiently severe to fall within the definition.  This is a factual conclusion which does not reveal any error: see similarly SZSYP (supra) at [44].  As the applicant has not established that the Tribunal failed to take account of the PAM 3 guidelines to the extent that they are relevant this ground fails. Ground three complains that the Tribunal failed to take into account a relevant consideration, which fails for the same reasons as ground two. Ground four of the application asserts the Tribunal failed to address a claim of persecution for imputed political opinion as a supporter of pro-Tamil political parties. The applicant claimed in written submissions before the delegate to fear harm because of “his family history of supporting pro-Tamil political parties” (CB 76.8), noting activities of his stepfather, uncle and stepbrother.  The applicant did not himself claim to be a supporter of such parties, or to have repeated the claim before the Tribunal.  Rather, he claimed in written submissions before the Tribunal to fear persecution on the Convention ground of imputed political opinion (suspected LTTE links) and as an “opponent of the Ruling party” (CB 192.3), but does not appear to have explained why he would be perceived as an “opponent of the Ruling party”. The Tribunal characterised the applicant’s claim relying on imputed political opinion as “he fears being imputed with a political opinion relating to links to the LTTE” (CB 219 at [18]).  The Tribunal noted the applicant’s oral evidence that he did not know of anyone in his family or step-family who had been involved with or supported the LTTE, although his stepfather had had to lend them a vehicle and the family had been forced to provide food (CB 220 at [31]).  The applicant does not appear to have made any reference to a family history of supporting pro-Tamil political parties or being an opponent of the Ruling party at the hearing (CB 222 at [47]). In the circumstance there was no “substantial, clearly articulated argument relying upon established facts” with Dranichnikov v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (2003) 77 ALJR 1088 at [24] that the applicant feared harm because of an imputed political opinion distinct from his claim to fear harm as having suspected LTTE links.  There was no fact basis established for such a claim, nor any clear articulation of it, beyond the vague assertions in the applicant’s submissions noted above.  It was therefore not a claim that the Tribunal was required to address: NABE v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (No. 2) [2004] FCAFC 263;  (2004) 144 FCR 1 at  [68]. As there is no jurisdictional error by the Tribunal its decision is a “privative clause decision” within s.474 of the Migration Act. The application should be dismissed with costs. Consideration Ground 1  Grounds 1, 2 and 3 of the application all concern the Tribunal’s complementary protection findings in respect of the applicant. At [69] of the Decision Record, the Tribunal accepted there was a real risk the applicant would be detained in prison on return to Sri Lanka for up to several nights as a result of his illegal departure from Sri Lanka (CB 226).  It then went on to make conclusive findings as to whether this detention would amount to significant harm for the purposes of the complementary protection criterion at [70]-[73] where it was ultimately not satisfied he would (CB 226-227). Ground 1 claims the Tribunal has erred in its understanding of what was degrading treatment or punishment, and cruel or inhuman treatment or punishment.  The submissions also complain that the Tribunal, in its Decision Record, failed to have regard to international authorities (see [21]-[22] above). In MZYYL (supra), their Honours Lander, Jessup and Gordon JJ stated at [18]-[20]:18. The complementary protection regime provides criteria for the grant of a protection visa in circumstances where the minister is not satisfied that Australia has protection obligations to that non-citizen under the Refugees Convention. The regime establishes criteria “that engage” Australia’s express and implied non-refoulement obligations under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (CAT) and the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CROC) (collectively the International Human Rights Treaties): Commonwealth, Parliamentary Debates, House of Representatives, 24 February 2011, 1357 (Chris Bowen, Minister for Immigration and Citizenship). The complementary protection regime is a code in the sense that the relevant criteria and obligations are defined in it and it contains its own definitions: see, by way of example, the definitions in s 5 of the Act of “torture” and “cruel or inhuman treatment or punishment”. Unlike s 36(2)(a), the criteria and obligations are not defined by reference to a relevant international law. Moreover, the complementary protection regime uses definitions and tests different from those referred to in the International Human Rights Treaties and the commentaries on those International Human Rights Treaties. For example, the definition of “torture” in the complementary protection regime is different from that in the CAT: see s 5(1) of the Act, Art 1 of the CAT and the explanatory memorandum in relation to the Bill at [52]. Further, the International Human Rights Treaties do not require the non-citizen to establish that the non-citizen could not avail himself or herself of the protection of the receiving country or that the non-citizen could not relocate within that country. Section 36(2B)(a) and (b) have adopted a different and contrary position. Section 36(2B)(a) and (b) relieve Australia from its protection obligations in s 36(2)(aa) if those two particular circumstances are satisfied.   19. Further, the test adopted in s 36(2)(aa), (2A) and (2B) is significant harm, not irreparable harm, being the test referred to in the General Comment No 31 on the ICCPR (Human Rights Committee, General Comment No 31: The Nature of the General Legal Obligations Imposed on State Parties to the Covenant, 80th sess, UN Doc CCPR/C/21/Rev.1/Add.13 (26 May 2004) at [12]), or serious harm, being the standard referred to and defined in s 91R of the Act.  20. It is therefore neither necessary nor useful to ask how the CAT or any of the International Law Treaties would apply to the circumstances of this case. The circumstances of this case are governed by the applicable provisions of the Act, namely s 36(2)(aa) and (2B), construed in the way that has been indicated. In SZSPE (supra), his Honour Yates J stated in respect of MZYYL (supra) at [43]:  43. The Full Court subsequently concluded (at [20]) that it was neither necessary nor useful to ask how the international law treaties would apply to the circumstances of the case before it. The same is true of the appellant‘s case before the Tribunal. The Tribunal was correct to proceed on the basis that its starting point must be the words of the Act itself. The complementary protection provisions are, therefore, a code and use language different to that contained in international human rights treaties.  Having regard to the Tribunal’s Decision Record, particularly [71]-[72] of the Decision Record and the authority of MZYYL (supra) and SZSPE (supra) above, I am satisfied the Tribunal did, in fact, correctly apply the terms of the legislation. No error on the part of the Tribunal is demonstrated in this ground and it should be dismissed. Ground 2  This ground alleges a failure on the part of the Tribunal to apply the PAM 3 Complementary Protection Guidelines (Exhibit “A3”), as is required under s.499 of the Migration Act.  Section 499 states:  Minister may give directions  (1)  The Minister may give written directions to a person or body having functions or powers under this Act if the directions are about:  (a)  the performance of those functions; or  (b)  the exercise of those powers.  (1A)  For example, a direction under subsection (1) could require a person or body to exercise the power under section 501 instead of the power under section 200 (as it applies because of section 201) in circumstances where both powers apply.  (2)  Subsection (1) does not empower the Minister to give directions that would be inconsistent with this Act or the regulations.  (2A)  A person or body must comply with a direction under subsection (1). Direction 56 issued under s.499 on 21 June 2013 relevantly states:  1. This Direction applies to a decision-maker performing function or exercising powers under section 65, 414 or 415 of the Migration Act 1958 (the Act) when considering an application for the grant of a Protection Visa and when reviewing a decision to refuse to grant a Protection Visa.  This direction is subject to the Migration Act and Regulations and other applicable laws.  2. In performing functions or exercising powers under section 65, 414 or 415 of the Act, the decision-maker is to take account of the following guidelines prepared by the Department of Immigration and Citizenship to the extent that they are relevant to the decision under consideration.  ‘PAM3: Refugee and humanitarian – Complementary Protection Guidelines’  ‘PAM3: Refugee and humanitarian – Refugee Law Guidelines’  3. Where the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has prepared a country information assessment expressly for protection status determination purposes, and that assessment is available to the decision maker, the decision maker must take into account that assessment, where relevant, in making their decision.  The decision maker is not precluded from considering other relevant information about the country. At [11] of the Decision Record the Tribunal stated:  11. In accordance with Ministerial Direction No.56, made under s.499 of the Act, the Tribunal is required to take account of policy guidelines prepared by the Department of Immigration – PAM3 Refugee and humanitarian – Complementary Protection Guidelines and PAM3: Refugee and humanitarian – Refugee Law Guidelines – to the extent that they are relevant to the decision under consideration.  I have done so.   Pursuant to s.499(2), Direction 56 cannot be inconsistent with the Migration Act.  I accept the Minister’s submission that the construction of the complementary protection provisions in MZYYL (supra) and SZSPE (supra) cannot have been altered by Direction 56.  Further, the decision of the UN Human Rights Committee cited by the applicant do not concern prison conditions in Sri Lanka, rather, at their highest they indicate that prison conditions in Sri Lanka could amount to “significant harm” as defined in ss.5(1) and 36(2)(aa) of the Migration Act. The Tribunal, at [69]-[73] of its Decision Record, rather, was not satisfied on the evidence before it that the conditions in prison in Sri Lanka, in respect of which there was a real risk the applicant would experience, could be said to involve a level of pain or suffering that could be regarded as cruel or inhuman in nature, or be intended to cause “extreme humiliation which is unreasonable”, to fall within the definition of significant harm. The Tribunal’s conclusions were factual in nature and open to it to make on the material before it and for the reasons it gave.  The applicant has, therefore, failed to establish the Tribunal failed to take account of the PAM 3 Guidelines.  Rather, on a fair reading, I accept the Tribunal has taken account of the Guidelines.  This ground should be dismissed. Ground 3  As Ground 3 is based on the same propositions as put forward in respect of Ground 2, noting the above findings, I am not satisfied this ground can be sustained.  It should be dismissed. Conclusion  I further note that the same grounds, though concerning a different applicant and factual premise, were put before Judge Cameron in SZTCU v Minister for Immigration & Anor  [2014] FCCA 1600.  His Honour dismissed them (grounds 3-5 in that case) and relevantly stated at [30]-[42]:  [30] Grounds three to five of the application involved an allegation that the Tribunal failed to consider the applicant’s claim to fear cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment if he returned to Sri Lanka. The applicant submitted that in addition to being at risk of torture in detention he would be subjected, by reason of the poor conditions in Sri Lankan gaols, to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment there.  [31] The applicant submitted in connection with this allegation that s.499(2A) of the Act obliged the Tribunal to comply with Ministerial Direction No.56 which in turn required it to take into account, to the extent relevant, a section of Procedures Advice Manual 3 entitled “Complementary Protection Guidelines“ (“CP Guidelines“). The applicant referred to:  a) 11 of the CP Guidelines which relevantly said:  These types of significant harm [referred to in s.36(2A) of the Act]are those in relation to which a non-refoulement obligation may be owed to a non-citizen in Australia and are based on the General Comments and views of the United Nations Human Rights Committee (UNHRC) and the United Nations Committee against Torture (UNCAT);  b) to para.14 which relevantly said:  The terms ‘torture’, ‘cruel or inhuman treatment or punishment’ and ‘degrading treatment or punishment’ are defined in s.5(1) of the Act. The definitions derive from, and require decision makers to turn their minds to, international jurisprudence;  c) to para.22, which concerned “Pain or suffering and ‘reasonably regarded as cruel or inhuman in nature’ “ and relevantly said:  Decision makers should interpret this part of the definition by reference to the international jurisprudence on the meaning of cruel or inhuman treatment or punishment in the context of Article 7 of the ICCPR;  d) to para.25 which relevantly said:  To meet the definition of degrading treatment or punishment, an act or omission must cause extreme humiliation. It is intended that the meaning of the term “extreme humiliation“ would be informed by international jurisprudence considering when treatment would constitute degrading treatment or punishment in breach of Article 7 of the ICCPR.   ...   The UNHRC has stated that ‘for punishment to be degrading, the humiliation or debasement involved must exceed a particular level and must, in any event, entail elements beyond the mere fact of deprivation of liberty. For more information on when prison conditions may amount to degrading treatment or punishment, see Imprisonment/Prison conditions;and  e) to para 29, entitled “About lawful sanctions“, which relevantly said:  Imprisonment / Prison conditions   ...   As with all types of torture and cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, a minimum level of severity is necessary in order to breach Article 7. The assessment of this minimum depends on all the circumstances of the case, such as the nature and context of the treatment, its duration, its physical or mental effects and, in some instances, the sex, age, state or health or other status of the victim.   Examples of conditions which have been held to constitute breaches of Article 7 include:   • extremely cramped or unsanitary conditions, exposure to cold or inadequate ventilation or lighting   • lack of adequately nutritious food or water, lack of adequate clothing or a separate bed, threats of torture or death, lack of opportunity for adequate exercise   ...   The existence of one relevantly minor condition (for example, a small cell) may not be sufficient to breach Article 7. However, the accumulation of a combination of poor or unreasonably restrictive conditions (for example, a small cell, overcrowding, prolonged detention and lack of opportunities for exercise) may raise the severity of the treatment above the necessary threshold.   (References omitted)  [32] The applicant submitted that in its reasons the Tribunal failed to refer to international jurisprudence or to demonstrate an awareness of the direction in the CP Guidelines that such jurisprudence be taken into account. In that context he referred to para.87 of the Tribunal’s reasons where it was said:  ‘Significant harm’ [for the purposes of the complementary protection tests] is exhaustively defined in s.36(2A): s.5(1). A person will suffer significant harm if he or she will be arbitrarily deprived of their life; or the death penalty will be carried out on the person; or the person will be subjected to torture; or to cruel or inhuman treatment or punishment; or to degrading treatment or punishment. ‘Cruel or inhuman treatment or punishment’, ‘degrading treatment or punishment’, and ‘torture’, are further defined in s.5(1) of the Act.   The applicant submitted that the Tribunal’s statement that the statutory definition was “exhaustive“ indicated that it had not taken the CP Guidelines into account and had thus misunderstood the applicable law.   [33] The applicant also referred to his advisers’ submissions to the Tribunal of 10 January 2013. At pages 14 and 15 of those submissions the applicant’s advisers stated:  The report by the UNCAT also details the degrading conditions faced by individuals held in detention in Sri Lanka as it noted:   The Committee is concerned at the deplorable levels of overcrowding and poor conditions prevailing at police stations and prisons, especially the lack of hygiene, inadequate medical care, the non-separation of convicted and remand prisoners and the failure to keep adult detainees and juvenile offenders separate, as reported by the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture [references omitted]. In this respect, the Committee regrets the absence of information provided by the State party on measures taken to improve conditions of detention for those held on remand and for convicted persons.  The degrading conditions experienced by detainees would extend to those who have been arrested for offences including the illegal departure from Sri Lanka. This has been confirmed in recent news articles on the fate of failed asylum seekers returned to Sri Lanka from Australia, like the one referred to above, that reports on the poor conditions including the overcrowding.   [34] Later in that submission they argued:  ... [the applicant] would face a risk of harm of a type that would constitute degrading treatment or punishment as defined under s36(2A)(e) of the Act on the basis that:   • The UN CAT’s recent report and other country information relating to the conditions faced by detainees in Sri Lanka supports there is[sic]substantial grounds for believing there is a real risk [the applicant] would face detention on his return and as a result would face a real risk of extreme humiliation that is unreasonable. Such treatment, as referred to in the UN CAT report above, includes facing overcrowded conditions with a lack of proper hygiene and medical facilities. This would go beyond the inevitable element of suffering or humiliation connected with a given form of legitimate treatment or punishment.   • The harm feared by [the applicant] would be intentionally inflicted on him in that the Sri Lankan authorities are either deliberately creating the conditions being faced by detainees in their detention centres or are deliberately failing to improve such conditions; and   • Like torture, degrading treatment or punishment is also prohibited under the Sri Lankan Constitution pursuant to Article 11 and so the use of degrading treatment or punishment could not be seen to ever be inherent in or incident to anylawfulsanction in Sri Lanka. ...   (Emphasis in original)  [35] The Tribunal’s findings on that issue were at paras.93 and 94 of its reasons:  The applicant’s submissions of 10 January 2013 refer to the prison conditions in Sri Lanka and, I accept that, many reputable reports indicate that prison conditions in Sri Lanka do not meet basic international standards. I accept that independent sources indicate that the conditions of detention the applicant will face while detained will be crowded, cramped and unpleasant. However, having regard to the characteristics of the victim, the duration of the detention, and the country information about prison conditions I am not satisfied that, in all the circumstances of the case it reaches the level of severity that amounts of ‘significant harm’ for the purpose of the complementary protection.   I therefore do not accept that, having regard to my findings about the circumstances and duration of the detention the applicant will face, there is a real risk that the applicant will be subjected to pain and suffering that could reasonably be characterised as ‘cruel or inhuman treatment or punishment’ within the meaning of subsection 5(1) of the Act and nor do I accept that he will face conditions of detention which could reasonably be regarded as amounting to degrading treatment or punishment.   [36] The applicant submitted that a further inference that the Tribunal had failed to consider the CP Guidelines could be drawn from the fact that those guidelines had a section on prison conditions, quoted above at [31], to which express reference was not made even though it referred to an international decision which dealt with a situation analogous to his own, involving extremely cramped and unsanitary prison conditions, and to another which dealt with threats of torture or death and a lack of water, adequately nutritious food, clothing, separate beds and opportunities for adequate exercise. The applicant submitted that, absent references to that section of the CP Guidelines, the Court could not be satisfied that the Tribunal had engaged in an active intellectual process in relation to those guidelines.  [37] The applicant also submitted that if the Tribunal had had regard to the CP Guidelines and the cases they cited, it could not have said, as it did at para.94 of its decision, that the prison conditions the applicant would face in Sri Lanka would not amount to cruel, inhuman or degrading punishment.  [38] In summary, the applicant submitted that the Tribunal had:  a) misunderstood the applicable law;  b) failed to comply with Ministerial Direction No.56; and  c) failed to take relevant considerations into account, namely international jurisprudence and the issues it raised.  Consideration   [39] In para.9 of its reasons the Tribunal said:  In accordance with Ministerial Direction No.56, made under s.499 of the Act, the Tribunal is required to take account of policy guidelines prepared by the Department of Immigration -PAM3 Refugee and humanitarian - Complementary Protection Guidelines and PAM3 Refugee and humanitarian - Refugee Law Guidelines - to the extent that they are relevant to the decision under consideration.   The Tribunal also referred to the CP Guidelines at para.10 of its decision when discussing the “real risk“ test to be applied to the complementary protection criteria. As with the Tribunal’s statement that it had considered the applicant’s advisers’ submissions of 10 January 2013, given that the Tribunal expressly referred to its obligations under the ministerial direction and the CP Guidelines, it should not lightly be inferred that the Tribunal failed to discharge those obligations.   [40] Dealing first with the applicant’s allegation that the Tribunal’s statement in para.87 of its reasons that the statutory definition was “exhaustive“ indicated that it had not taken the CP Guidelines into account and had thus misunderstood the applicable law, I am not persuaded that it can be inferred from the way the Tribunal expressed itself in that paragraph that it did not consider the CP Guidelines. Those guidelines do not purport to define the component elements of “significant harm“. Rather, they discuss matters which may be taken into consideration when determining whether a particular circumstance amounts to significant harm. Consequently, the Tribunal was not wrong to say that the terms were defined by the statute, not least because s.499(2) subordinated the ministerial direction to the terms of the Act.  [41] The applicant placed considerable emphasis on the fact that the CP Guidelines contained a section dealing specifically with imprisonment and prison conditions, those guidelines saying in para.29, as quoted earlier in these reasons:  As with all types of torture and cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, a minimum level of severity is necessary in order to breach Article 7. The assessment of this minimum depends on all the circumstances of the case, such as the nature and context of the treatment, its duration, its physical or mental effects and, in some instances, the sex, age, state of health or other status of the victim.   In the second and third sentences of para.93 of its reasons the Tribunal said:  ... I accept that independent sources indicate that the conditions of detention the applicant will face while detained will be crowded, cramped and unpleasant. However, having regard to the characteristics of the victim, the duration of the detention, and the country information about prison conditions I am not satisfied that, in all the circumstances of the case it reaches the level of severity that amounts of ‘significant harm’ ...   [42] I infer from the choice of words in those latter sentences, particularly “victim“ and “level of severity“, that the Tribunal had had regard to para.29 of the CP Guidelines. As the international jurisprudence to which the applicant particularly referred was cited in that paragraph of the CP Guidelines, I conclude that the Tribunal’s consideration of that paragraph included a consideration of the international jurisprudence referred to there. The Tribunal was not relevantly required to do more. Neither the ministerial direction nor the CP Guidelines required the Tribunal to look first at the guidelines and then separately at international cases. The guidelines simply required the Tribunal to have regard to international jurisprudence. As that jurisprudence was set out in the guidelines themselves, the Tribunal discharged its relevant obligation by considering those guidelines. Ground 4  This ground alleges that the Tribunal failed to address a claim of persecution raised by the applicant for imputed political opinion as a supporter of pro-Tamil political parties. In written submissions prepared by the applicant’s adviser for the Protection visa hearing before the delegate, the following claims were advanced:  We submit because of the following reasons [SZTCV] faces a real chance of persecution on his return to Sri Lanka:  ...  The Sri Lanka authorities perceive his brother [XX] of having links to the LTTE.  The authorities required him to report to the authorities on a weekly basis because of his suspected ties to the LTTE;  His family history of supporting pro Tamil political parties.  His step father was imprisoned and tortured in the past because of involvement the EPDP and his uncle has also stood for election in 2010 for the Tamil National Alliance and his step brother [XX] helped him campaign;  ... (CB 76) The applicant’s adviser then made the following written submissions in respect of the hearing before the Tribunal:  [SZTCV] ... is suspected of being a LTTE supporter and, through his family, actively providing shelter to them. ... The fact is his stepfather did provide material assistance to the LTTE such as motor transport vehicles.  His stepfather had two of these vehicles to use in his fishing business. At [31] of its Decision Record, the Tribunal stated:  31. He did not know if anyone in either his birth family or step-family had been involved with or supported the LTTE willingly in any way during the war although, like many other Tamils, his stepfather had had to lend them a vehicle and the family had been forced to provide food.  He said he was close to his mother and he thought she would have told him if anyone in the family had willingly helped the LTTE.  ... (CB 220) At [44] the Tribunal stated:  44. As to if there had been any problems for his family since he left Sri Lanka, he indicated he was unaware of any. (CB 222) At [51] the Tribunal stated:  51. ... There is also no evidence that anyone in his family was or is suspected of being an LTTE sympathiser. The initial claims advanced before the delegate in respect of the applicant’s family’s current or previous support of the LTTE or other pro-Tamil political parties was abandoned before the Tribunal.  The claim that was put before the Tribunal in written submissions was much narrower, however, at the hearing this was qualified further (see [xx] above). Having regard to the above extracts from the Court Book and Decision Record, I accept the Minister’s submission that there was no “substantial, clearly articulated argument relying upon established facts” in the manner set out in Dranichnikov (supra) at [24] that the applicant feared harm based on an imputed political opinion as distinct from his claim to fear harm as a result of having suspected LTTE links.   In NABE (supra) at [68] the full Court stated:  68. Although such a claim might have been seen as arising on the material before the tribunal it did not represent, in any way, “a substantial clearly articulated argument relying upon established facts” in the sense in which that term was used in Dranichnikov. A judgment that the tribunal has failed to consider a claim not expressly advanced is, as already indicated in these reasons, not lightly to be made. The claim must emerge clearly from the materials before the tribunal. In our opinion the judgment that the tribunal, by reason of the error it made about the appellant’s involvement with PLOTE, failed to consider an unexpressed claim of want of effective state protection against persecution by PLOTE, is not open having regard to the thresholds required for such a judgment by the authorities to which we have referred. This case does demonstrate an unfortunate factual error which, as Tamberlin J found, contributed to the tribunal’s adverse finding as to credibility and could have affected the outcome of the review by the tribunal. It did not, however, constitute jurisdictional error in the sense earlier discussed. It was, as the members of the Full Court found on the first occasion, an error of fact within jurisdiction. I am not satisfied a substantial clearly articulated argument relying upon established facts was advanced by the applicant as contended.  Accordingly, there was not a claim before the Tribunal that it was required to address.  This ground cannot be sustained and should be dismissed. The “WZAPN” Issue  On 3 September 2014, the Federal Court of Australia delivered judgment in the matter WZAPN v Minister for Immigration and Border Protection  [2014] FCA 947 per North J. On 1 October 2014, the Minister filed in the High Court of Australia an Application for Special Leave to Appeal from the judgment of North J in WZAPN (supra).  Consequently, as other proceedings addressing this specific issue had requested the reserved judgment not be finalised until the High Court decision was known, I have adopted that approach for this current matter. Failed Protection visa applicants of Tamil ethnicity returning to Sri Lanka voluntarily or by escort on temporary travel documents from a Western country will be questioned by the authorities and may be arrested and held on remand for a few days whilst waiting for a court appearance facing charges including possible breaches of the Immigration and Emigration Act 1949.   Various country reports together with a Sydney Morning Herald article of 8-9 December 2012 indicate that people are detained possibly for 3 days after which they are bailed for a future court appearance.  The hearing may levy a fine based on a law of general application relating to illegal departure from Sri Lanka.  Country information indicates that there is some evidence demonstrating that the law is discriminatorily applied to people of Tamil ethnicity.  As the entry point is usually Colombo, remand would be served in Negombo Prison which is cramped and unsanitary.  The question arises as to whether being questioned, detained for up to 3 days and significant fines are of the type and seriousness of harm amounting to persecution as meant by s.91R of the Migration Act.  In WZAPN (supra), North J held that the application of s.91R did not permit a quantitative assessment of the nature of the harm required to be considered by that section.   His Honour described the approach taken by the Reviewer at [18], where he states:   18. The reviewer accepted that there was a real chance that the applicant would be questioned periodically and probably detained for short periods when he failed to provide identification, but held that the frequency and length of the detention, and the nature of the treatment he would receive in detention, did not amount to serious harm within s 91R(2)(a), (b) or (c). The reviewer concluded that on this analysis, the nature of the detention was not sufficiently significant and thus did not constitute serious harm ... In approaching the matter in this way, the reviewer made a qualitative assessment of the nature of the harm caused by the detention. The argument was recorded by his Honour as:  20.  The applicant contended in his original written submissions, and in oral submissions, that the reviewer wrongly applied a qualitative assessment to the nature of the harm. The applicant argued that s 91R(2)(a) is concerned with the threat, in the sense of a risk, of harm to life and liberty, whatever the nature of the harm. Whether there is a threat depends on an assessment of the likelihood of harm happening. But once that threat is established, s 91R(2)(a) operates so that the threat to life or liberty amounts to serious harm irrespective of the nature or extent of the potential harm to life or liberty. Thus, there is no place for an assessment of the frequency or degree of the harm, or the circumstances which attend such harm, save only for a de minimus exclusion. Consequently, once the reviewer found that the applicant was at risk of detention, serious harm was established within the meaning of s 91R(2)(a) irrespective of the significance of the circumstances attending the detention. That argument was accepted by his Honour at [30], [44] and [45] where his Honour stated:  30. The conclusion from the language and structure of s 91R(2) is that serious harm in s 91R(1)(b) is constituted by a threat to life or liberty, without reference to the severity of the consequences to life or liberty.   ...  44. In taking the human rights approach, there is no place for a qualitative assessment of detention affecting the right to liberty for it to constitute an infringement of that right.  45. By making a qualitative assessment of the nature and degree of the harm experienced by the applicant when asking whether the threat to the applicant’s liberty was sufficiently significant, the reviewer in the present case applied the wrong test in the application of s 91R(2)(a), and thereby fell into jurisdictional error. North J’s decision in WZAPN v Minister for Immigration and Border Protection (supra) has been considered in the following Full Federal Court decisions; SZTEQ v Minister for Immigration and Border Protection  [2015] FCAFC 39 per Robertson, Griffiths and Mortimer JJ; BZAFM v Minister for Immigration and Border Protection  [2015] FCAFC 41 per Robertson, Griffith and Mortimer JJ; and SZTIB v Minister for Immigration and Border Protection [2015] FCAFC 40 per Robertson, Griffith and Mortimer JJ. After a detailed consideration of the approach of the construction of s.91R and to the test in s.91R(1) and (2) their Honours found in SZTEQ at [58]-[60]:    58. Another aspect of the structure of s 91R(1), which we have touched on above, concerns the fact that it contains three separate and cumulative conditions for persecution to be established for the purposes of the Migration Act and the regulations, of which the requirement of serious harm is only one. We acknowledge that matters such as the length of detention, its frequency, purpose and character may also arise in determining whether the reason for the detention, which must be a Convention reason, is the essential and significant reason for the persecution (as required by s 91R(1)(a)) or involves systematic and discriminatory conduct (as required by s 91R(1)(c)). However, this does not mean that such matters may not also arise for consideration and evaluation in relation to the requirement of serious harm within s 91R(1)(b).  59.  Unlike North J in WZAPN, we do not consider the absence of adjectival qualification in s 91R(2)(a) to be of significance, given the context of the provision as a whole. Rather, the absence of an adjective indicates that a threat to “liberty“ is not synonymous with the possibility of a person being held briefly on remand or detained for a short time for questioning. In this context, “liberty“ is a nuanced concept which takes its meaning from the context in which it appears, namely the requirement that the persecution involve serious harm, as is made clear in s 91R(1).  60.  With great respect to the different view expressed in WZAPN at [30], we do not consider that the structure of s 91R(2) supports a construction of that provision to the effect that any threat to liberty constitutes serious harm without reference to the severity of the threat to liberty. As Dixon CJ observed in a frequently cited passage in Commissioner for Railways (NSW) v Agalianos  [1955] HCA 27 ;  (1955) 92 CLR 390 at 397:  ... the general purpose and policy of a provision and its consistency and fairness are surer guides to its meaning than the logic with which it is constructed. In the conclusion of SZTEQ at [154]-[155], their Honours state:  154.  For the above reasons, and with great respect to North J, we do not consider that WZAPN correctly decided the construction of s 91R(2)(a). In our opinion, s 91R(2)(a) should not be construed as meaning that any deprivation of liberty constitutes serious harm for the purposes of s 91R(1)(b) and Art 1A(2).  155. As the above analysis has sought to show, even if there was no error in his Honour’s examination of ss 91R(1) and (2) and the Convention concept of persecution by reference to “international human rights standards“ (see his Honour’s reasons at [43]), an issue which need not be determined in this appeal, contrary to his Honour’s reasoning, neither those standards, nor the jurisprudence and commentary about those standards in refugee decision-making supports the proposition that any deprivation of liberty must constitute serious harm for the purpose of the Convention. On 17 June 2015 the High Court unanimously allowed an appeal from the Federal Court: see Minister for Immigration and Border Protection v WZAPN & Anor  [2015] HCA 22.  It also unanimously dismissed an appeal from the Federal Court which was WZARV v Minister for Immigration and Border Protection (2014) 144 ALD 82.  The High Court held that the likelihood of a period of temporary detention of a person for a reason mentioned in the Refugees Convention is not, of itself and without more, a threat to liberty within the meaning of s.91R(2)(a) of the Migration Act.  Conclusion  None of the pleaded grounds in further amended application can be sustained.  On a fair reading of the evidence before the Court, no error on the part of the Tribunal is apparent. I am satisfied the application should be dismissed with the applicant ordered to pay the Minister’s costs.I certify that the preceding ninety-six (96) paragraphs are a true copy of the reasons for judgment of Judge Lloyd-JonesAssociate:  Date:  19 June 2015       ',\n",
       " 'SZTPJ v Minister for Immigration & Anor [2015] FCCA 1992 (29 July 2015)': \" Background  This is an application for review of a decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal dated 7 November 2013.  The Tribunal affirmed a decision of a delegate of the First Respondent not to grant the Applicant a protection visa.   The Applicant, a citizen of Bangladesh, arrived in Australia in May 2011. He applied for a protection visa in August 2011.  In essence, the Applicant claimed to fear harm if he returned to Bangladesh because of his political opinion as a member of the Bangladesh National Party (the “BNP”) and his religion as Hindu. He claimed that he joined the BNP in 2005 and was joint secretary of the BNP for a particular area from 2005 to 2011, although he also claimed he worked and lived in South Korea from 2006 to 2011. The Applicant claimed he was attacked by the members of the Awami League (the “AL”) in 2006 and fled to Korea.  He claimed he returned to Bangladesh in 2010 to see his sick mother in hospital, but did not return to his home town.  He claimed that after he returned to Korea he heard that Muslim terrorists had assaulted his sister and that she had committed suicide as a result.  He claimed that his father’s business was destroyed and that his brother was tortured after he reported the assault on his sister.  He claimed the police would not help his family. The Applicant claimed that he returned to Bangladesh in 2011.  In his visa application the Applicant claimed that he was arrested by Rapid Action Battalion (“RAB”) officers in front of Mirpur Stadium, was released after his sister arranged payment and hid in Dhaka for a “few days” before leaving Bangladesh on 6 May 2011 for Korea.  From Korea he came to Australia.   However, according to the delegate, at interview he claimed that he had been arrested by police officers at a World Cup Cricket quarter final between New Zealand and South Africa at the Sher-e-Bangla National Cricket Stadium, Dhaka on 25 March 2011.  He presented a ticket in support of this claim and submitted photographs which purported to show him being arrested by police inside the stadium.  He claimed that the AL had found out that he had gone to the cricket match and had sent the police to harass him.  He claimed that he was released from police custody after payment of money.  He claimed that the police had told him that there was a case pending against him.   The Applicant also claimed at the departmental interview that he had been involved in an incident on 8 April 2011 between police and BNP activists during a BNP conference he attended.   The Applicant also claimed that he was involved with the BNP in Australia and that he feared persecution on that basis.   In addition, the Applicant claimed that as a Hindu he had been discriminated against throughout his life by Muslims in Bangladesh.   The Applicant submitted a number of documents in support of his claims, discussed further below where relevant. On 3 August 2012 a delegate of the First Respondent refused the application finding, on the basis of serious deficiencies, inconsistencies and implausibilties in the Applicant’s claims and testimony, that the Applicant was not a credible witness.   The Tribunal Review   The Applicant sought review by the Tribunal by application lodged on 6 September 2012.  On 11 July 2013 the Tribunal wrote to the Applicant, inviting him to attend a Tribunal hearing on 12 August 2013.  In his response to the hearing invitation, the Applicant asked the Tribunal to take oral evidence from a Mr Roy about the Applicant’s political involvement, persecution and religious problems. He described Mr Roy as his “political leader” and provided a Bangladeshi address and telephone number.  He had previously provided a letter of support from Mr Roy on letterhead which described him as a member of the National Standing Committee of the BNP in Bangladesh. The Applicant attended the Tribunal hearing with his migration agent.  A transcript of the hearing of 12 August 2013 is in evidence before the Court as an annexure to the affidavit of Hervee Dupont Dejean, affirmed on 27 November 2014.   On 22 August 2013 the Tribunal wrote to the Applicant pursuant to s.424A of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) (the “Act”), raising with him a number of issues for comment or response.  The Applicant responded through his adviser, by letter dated 5 September 2013.   On 2 October 2013 the Tribunal wrote to the Applicant inviting him to a further hearing on 4 November 2013.  In addition, the Tribunal advised the Applicant’s adviser that he should provide a written submission setting out all claims made and maintained by the Applicant by 28 October 2013 and a signed declaration from the Applicant accepting the accuracy and completeness of such submission.  The adviser was also informed that if it was proposed that a witness give evidence at the further hearing, a witness statement should be provided or, if that was not possible, particulars should be provided of the evidence the witness was expected to address and how it was relevant to the case. The adviser did not provide any written submission or signed declaration from the Applicant.  Nor was any request made that evidence be taken from any witness at the second hearing.  At the second hearing the Applicant provided the Tribunal with further evidence, including a letter from a psychologist and also a letter a said to be from his mother in relation to a land dispute and a corrected version of the response to the s.424A letter.  A transcript of the hearing of 4 November 2013 is also in evidence before the Court as an annexure to the affidavit of Ms Dejean. The Tribunal Decision   On 7 November 2013 the Tribunal affirmed the decision not to grant the Applicant a protection visa.  The Tribunal summarised the Applicant’s claims.  It listed the documents he had provided in support of his claims.  It recorded that he had appeared before the Tribunal on 12 August 2013. It referred to the country information and medical evidence he had provided and also to the s.424A letter and the response. The Tribunal stated that it had had concerns in relation to the Applicant’s evidence and that it had wanted to explore the claims related to his family’s land in greater detail.  Hence it had invited him to give evidence at the second hearing on 4 November 2013.  The Tribunal accepted that the Applicant was a citizen of Bangladesh.  However it found that aspects of the information he had provided to the Department and to the Tribunal gave rise to concerns relating to the credibility and plausibility of his claims.  The Tribunal explained that these concerns related to inconsistencies between the evidence the Applicant had presented to the Department and his evidence to the Tribunal and also inconsistencies in his evidence to the Tribunal, as well as the implausibility of aspects of his claims.  It set out its “primary concerns” in some detail.   First, under the heading “Political Claims”, the Tribunal expressed what it described as “significant” concerns about the Applicant’s claim to have been arrested at a World Cup Cricket match on 25 March 2011 in light of inconsistencies between his written statement, his evidence at the departmental interview and at the Tribunal hearing in relation to the stage in the match at which he was arrested (whether it was just after the coin toss or part-way through the game), whether he was arrested inside or outside the stadium, whether he was arrested by the RAB or by police officers or both, and whether the match was delayed by rain.  The Tribunal observed that it had listened to a recording of the Applicant’s departmental interview. It was of the view that the Applicant’s evidence at that interview had been clear, and that he had claimed he had been arrested by police officers at around 6:00-6:30pm, which he said was just after the coin toss as the game had been delayed by rain.  The Tribunal found that while there was significant discussion with the delegate in relation to this claim, the Applicant had been consistent and clear in his claims. However it had regard to independent evidence in relation to the cricket match in question which it found clearly showed that the game in question was not delayed by rain and was played during daylight.   The Tribunal found that the Applicant’s evidence about this claim at the Tribunal hearing was “markedly different” to his evidence at the departmental interview.  At the Tribunal hearing he stated that he was arrested by police officers and RAB working together at 6:00 or 6:30 pm, but that this was in the middle of the cricket match and that there was no rain delay.  The Tribunal observed that this evidence was also different to the Applicant’s written statement in support of his protection visa application (in which he had stated that he had been arrested in front of Mirpur Stadium by the RAB).  The Tribunal had raised these concerns with the Applicant, including in the s.424A letter. It had regard to his explanation that he was mistaken in his evidence as a result of his mental state.  It acknowledged that he had provided a medical certificate stating that he was suffering from a major depressive disorder and that he was on medication which affected his ability to concentrate. However it also had regard to the fact that at the start of the Tribunal hearing the Applicant had expressly stated that the fact that he was on medication would not affect his ability to provide evidence.   The Tribunal also considered the Applicant’s claim at the hearing that his inconsistent evidence about his arrest was because he was “preoccupied by his difficulties” and therefore did not concentrate on the cricket match.  However the Tribunal found that, given the clarity and the depth of the Applicant’s evidence to the Department and the significantly differing accounts of his arrest, it did not accept that he was merely mistaken in his evidence to the Department.  Moreover, given his expressed passion for cricket, the Tribunal did not find it plausible that the Applicant would not notice for a period of three to four hours whether the match had started or not and whether it was delayed by rain or not.  The Tribunal considered that the Applicant had fabricated his evidence in relation to the arrest. Insofar as the Applicant claimed that he had initially been mistaken about whether the people who arrested him were RAB officers and subsequently claimed that both the police and the RAB were involved, the Tribunal did not draw any adverse conclusions from the inconsistency about who arrested the Applicant.  However it considered that the other inconsistencies were so significant that it was not satisfied that the Applicant had been truthful in his account of this event and the claimed arrest. The Tribunal also expressed concern about why the Applicant would attend a cricket match while he was in hiding.  It found that his claim that his friends persuaded him to do so as he was in a very stressful and traumatic situation was unpersuasive, as it appeared to be very likely there would be security or a police presence at the match. It found that it did not appear credible that a person who was in hiding would attend such an event.  However the Tribunal acknowledged that the Applicant had provided a ticket from the match in March 2011 and a photograph of himself at the stadium with what appeared to be police officers.  In light of these pieces of evidence from March 2011, the Tribunal accepted that the Applicant attended a cricket match in Bangladesh as claimed.  However, it did not accept that he was arrested there.   The Tribunal referred to the fact that the Applicant had also provided a FIR in relation charges against him and a statement of the officer in charge.  However it considered country information about the ready availability of forged or fraudulently obtained documents and the level of corruption in Bangladesh.  The Tribunal was of the view that the Applicant could have obtained these documents fraudulently and hence placed little weight on these legal documents and the photograph said to be of the Applicant being arrested. Secondly, the Tribunal expressed concerns about the Applicant’s claims about his role in the BNP.  It found that the claims in his written statement clearly suggested that he joined the BNP for protection sometime after he completed his HSC (which he did not finish until April or May 2006) after being tortured by Muslims who took things from his father’s shop. However at the Tribunal hearing he had claimed he had become active in the BNP at a young age and that he became “very” active in late 2005.  He claimed he was appointed Joint Secretary in April or May 2005.  The Tribunal found that these accounts of when the Applicant’s involvement with the BNP began were so inconsistent that it cast doubt on whether he was involved with the BNP at all. In addition, the Tribunal found that the Applicant was still studying full time at High School and on his own evidence had not yet started being “very active” in the BNP at a time he claimed he was appointed Joint Secretary.  The Tribunal did not find this credible.  It did not accept the Applicant’s explanation that it was his close connection to Mr Roy that enabled him to be appointed Joint Secretary at a very young age. It found that the examples he cited of other persons in Bangladeshi politics who had achieved prominent roles at a very young age because of their familial connections were examples of members of the same family and that none appeared to be as young as the Applicant had been. The Tribunal addressed the Applicant’s claim that he had been able to continue in his role as Joint Secretary even after he left Bangladesh and lived in South Korea from 2006 to 2011.  The Tribunal found that this was not credible, as it appeared to be inconsistent with the Applicant’s description of the role of Joint Secretary (to attend meetings, print and publish posters, encourage local people to join, fill in when the secretary was absent and give guidance to workers under him).  It did not appear to the Tribunal that any of these aspects of the role could be satisfied while the Applicant was in South Korea.  It observed that when this issue was discussed with the Applicant at the hearing he had claimed that none of the positions had changed in ten years, that although his responsibility was less, he continued to correspond with the party and provide financial support while in Korea and that this, together with the ongoing support of Mr Roy, meant that he continued in the position.  As it had discussed with the Applicant at the second hearing, the Tribunal did not accept that this evidence was credible as it was inconsistent with the Article of the BNP Constitution which stated that the role of Joint Secretary should be held for a period of two years.  The Tribunal also found that this claim was inconsistent with the Applicant’s evidence that the role of Joint Secretary changed when he was elected in 2005. The Tribunal continued:  21. In contrast to these concerns, the applicant has provided letters of support from Mr Roy (Member of the National Standing Committee) and Mr Uddin (Convenor of BNP [for a particular area]) which confirm the applicant’s position as Joint Secretary [for a particular region].  However, in light of the above information about the prevalence of fraudulent and forged documents, the Tribunal places little weight on these letters and does not consider that they overcome the Tribunal’s concerns.  The letter from Mr Hossain (Convenor of BNP Australia) also refers to the applicant as Joint Secretary of [the particular area in Bangladesh].  However, he states that he has only known the applicant since the applicant’s arrival in Australia.  Therefore, the Tribunal places little weight on this letter as evidence of the applicant’s activities in Bangladesh and does not consider that it overcomes the Tribunal’s concerns. The Tribunal also had regard to concerns about the Applicant’s claims he attended a BNP conference on 8 April 2011. It noted that this event was during the time the Applicant claimed to have been in hiding at his uncle’s house after being released following his arrest.  While he initially claimed that he stayed at his uncle’s house during this time and communicated with his party by telephone only, he subsequently “inconsistently” stated that he decided to attend the conference because he was Joint Secretary and was in Bangladesh.  The Tribunal did not find this persuasive, having regard to the Applicant’s claims that he was in hiding as he was afraid he would be killed because of his political activities and the fact that he had previously been in South Korea for many years without any need to attend meetings.  The Tribunal did not find it credible that the Applicant would choose to attend a high-profile conference because of a sense of duty.  Insofar as he later claimed that he also secretly attended the party office as well as the conference, the Tribunal found that this was inconsistent with his earlier evidence that he only communicated with the party by phone while in hiding. The Tribunal acknowledged that the Applicant had provided newspaper reports in relation to the conference and the ensuing violence between the BNP and the AL which had resulted in charges being laid. However it found that these reports did not refer to the Applicant.  While the Tribunal accepted that the conference occurred, it placed little weight on these reports as evidence of the Applicant’s involvement with the conference.  The Tribunal considered a letter from a named advocate about charges said to have been laid against the Applicant, an FIR report and a statement of an officer in charge in which the Applicant was named as involved in the violence.  However, in light of country information it had referred to in relation to the prevalence of fraudulent and forged documents in Bangladesh and the extent of corruption, the Tribunal placed little weight on these documents in support of the Applicant’s claim that there were false charges outstanding against him in Bangladesh. In addition, the Tribunal found the Applicant’s evidence about where and for how long he had been in hiding was inconsistent.  In his written statement the Applicant had claimed that after he was released he hid “in Dhaka” for “a few days” and departed Bangladesh on 6 May 2011.  However at the Tribunal hearing the Applicant had claimed he had been in hiding at his uncle’s house from his release on 25 March 2011 until his departure from Bangladesh on 6 May 2011.  He also claimed that his uncle’s house was some 60 or 70 kilometres from Dhaka.  The Tribunal considered, but did not accept, the Applicant’s explanation for those inconsistencies. In particular, the Tribunal considered that there was a significant difference between being in hiding for a few days and for over a month, which could not be explained solely by language difficulties.  This raised concerns for the Tribunal about whether the Applicant was in hiding as claimed. The Tribunal also found that the Applicant’s evidence in relation to his return to Bangladesh in 2009/2010 was inconsistent, in particular as to whether he had just stayed by his mother’s side in hospital for a few days and had not seen any other family members or relatives or whether he had taken her to his uncle’s home where he remained until he returned to South Korea. Finally, the Tribunal found that the Applicant’s claims in support of his protection visa application that he had been physically attacked before he joined the BNP were inconsistent with his evidence at the Tribunal hearing that he was attacked in 2006, by which time he was already Joint Secretary within the local BNP.  The Tribunal had regard to the fact that the Applicant had not referred to a 2006 attack at the departmental interview and only raised this claim at the Tribunal hearing when the Tribunal asked him why a supporting letter from a Mr Uddin referred to him having been physically attacked. The Tribunal did not accept the Applicant’s explanation for this inconsistency.  It found that the Applicant’s failure to raise this claim earlier and the inconsistency between his written and oral claims raised doubts about whether the Applicant had been attacked as claimed. The Tribunal acknowledged that the Applicant had provided two medical certificates which referred to him having pain in his right hip and back, but observed that these did not provide any history about his injuries or opinion about what caused the pain or the nature or severity of the injuries.  In these circumstances it placed no weight on these medical certificates in support of the Applicant’s claims to have been attacked in Bangladesh. The Tribunal observed that there were other items of information and inconsistencies it had put to the Applicant in the s.424A letter and at the hearing. However it accepted that no witness’ evidence would be entirely consistent.  In addition, in light of the psychologist’s report, it accepted that the Applicant was on medication and suffering from a depressive mental condition which may have affected his ability to concentrate on occasions (despite his evidence to the contrary at the hearing).  The Tribunal stated that it had drawn no adverse conclusions from those other inconsistencies and accepted the explanations provided by the Applicant.  However it was not satisfied that the Applicant’s depression or medication could explain the concerns detailed in its decision. The Tribunal concluded that in light of these concerns it was not satisfied that the Applicant was a credible witness.  It was not satisfied that the Applicant was involved with the BNP in Bangladesh; that he held any position with it; that he was attacked, threatened, or subject to extortion by the AL; that his brother or sister had been attacked by the AL; that his family’s shop or business was destroyed by the AL as a result of his political opinion or activities; that any false charges had been laid against him in Bangladesh; or that he was arrested or detained in Bangladesh. The Tribunal acknowledged that the Applicant had provided a letter of support from the Chairman of Konda Union Parishad, stating that the Applicant was of good moral character. However it observed that this letter did not refer to the Applicant’s protection visa application or claims.  The Tribunal found that this letter did not overcome its concerns in relation to the Applicant’s credibility.   While the Tribunal had some concerns about the evidence the Applicant provided concerning his relationship with Dr Yunus (which he claimed was intended to show he was from a wealthy influential background), it was willing to accept that he knew Dr Yunus, but did not have a close relationship with him.  However the Tribunal did not consider that this overcame its concerns in relation to the Applicant’s credibility.   The Tribunal also had regard to the letter of support from the Convener of the Bangladesh Jatiaotabadi Dal. Australia (“BJD”) in Australia in relation to the Applicant’s claims about his activities in Australia.  The Tribunal observed that while the letter stated that the Applicant had joined the BNP in Australia, it gave no information about what role the Applicant played or how active he was in BNP in Australia.  Moreover, while the letter stated that the Applicant faced a “life threatening problem in Bangladesh at the moment”, it did not suggest this was a result of his activities in Australia.  The Tribunal had regard to the fact that at the first Tribunal hearing, the Applicant had said he did not do much in Australia for the BNP, but attended meetings and discussed what was happening in Bangladesh and that when the “home minister” visited Australia they had held a protest.  At the second Tribunal hearing the Applicant had also stated that his family was not aware of his activities in Australia, but that two of his BNP colleagues were, that he did not hold a position within the BNP in Australia but that they were planning that he may do so in the future.  The Tribunal was willing to accept that the Applicant had joined the BNP in Australia, but did not consider that there was any evidence to suggest that the Applicant’s activities with the BNP in Australia would be known to the AL in Bangladesh or would cause him any difficulties in Bangladesh.   In light of its findings in relation to the Applicant’s credibility and lack of political involvement in Bangladesh, the Tribunal found that the Applicant’s involvement with the BNP in Australia was solely for the purpose of strengthening his claim to be a refugee within the meaning of the Refugees Convention and it therefore disregarded that conduct in accordance with s.91R(3) of the Act.  It was not satisfied that the Applicant had any genuine interest in the BNP or that he would participate in the BNP or its related activities if he returned to Bangladesh. Under the heading “Religious Claims”, the Tribunal accepted that the Applicant was a Hindu.  It discussed country information in relation to the situation for Hindus in Bangladesh.  It considered the Applicant’s claim that when he was growing up he saw Muslims taking things from his father’s shop and not paying for them and that his father had no recourse; and that after his father died (and before 2006) threats were directed at him asking him to pay money because of the family business.  The Tribunal observed that the Applicant had not referred to this claim in his written statement when discussing difficulties the store had with Muslims.  It found that the claim was not credible.  It had regard to the fact that at the time in question the Applicant was still in school and that his uncle was running the shop. The Tribunal was of the view that if there had been extortion demands they would have been directed towards the Applicant’s uncle, rather than the Applicant.  Insofar as the Applicant had claimed at the Tribunal hearing that the threats were directed at him because he was politically active, the Tribunal had regard to its finding that he was not involved in politics as claimed.  In light of its credibility findings and concerns about this claim, the Tribunal was not satisfied that the Applicant was subject to extortion or death threats while in Bangladesh as claimed. Having regard to country information, the Tribunal was willing to accept that Muslims may have taken things from the father’s shop without paying for them. However it was not satisfied that this would constitute serious harm, having regard to the fact that the Applicant’s father appeared to be a wealthy and successful businessman with land and property. The Tribunal was not satisfied, on the evidence before it, that the Applicant had suffered serious harm as a result of being a Hindu in the past or that he would suffer serious harm if he were to return to Bangladesh now or in the reasonably foreseeable future as a result of his religion. Under the heading “Land Claims”, the Tribunal considered a claim that had been raised by the Applicant at the end of the first Tribunal hearing.  He claimed he feared returning to Bangladesh because the AL was trying to take over the family shop and make it into the AL office, and that to achieve these ends the AL had told people that they had bought the land from the Applicant.  He feared they would kill him for his land.  The Tribunal had explored this claim further at the second hearing, when the Applicant presented a letter from his mother stating that the AL leader had occupied the family land and had told the local people that the AL had purchased it.  His mother claimed she tried to go to the police, but that they would not take her case and that she thought the AL would kill the Applicant because of this if he returned. The Tribunal did not find the Applicant’s evidence in relation to this claim to be credible.  It had regard to the fact that at the first hearing he claimed his mother had told him that the AL was trying to make the family shop into the party office and occupy the land, whereas at the second hearing he had stated that the shop and home were located on separate pieces of land and that the AL was targeting the home although they may in future want to target the shop. Furthermore, when asked at the second hearing (in November 2013) when he had found out about this, the Applicant had stated that it had been about a month earlier. The Tribunal found that this was inconsistent with his evidence at the 1 August 2013 hearing that his mother had already told him that the AL wanted the family’s shop and land.  The Tribunal did not find the Applicant’s explanation for this inconsistency persuasive. Finally, the Tribunal did not find it credible that the AL would want to kill the Applicant if he returned to Bangladesh because of the land, but had taken no action in Bangladesh against his brother (who also legally owned the land) or his mother (who had tried to take action by going to the police). In light of the timing of this claim, the inconsistencies in the Applicant’s evidence and the Tribunal’s general concerns about his credibility, it was not satisfied that the AL was trying to take over the family shop or land or would harm the Applicant in order to do so.  It was not satisfied there was a real chance the Applicant would be persecuted because of his family’s land in Bangladesh.  The Tribunal considered the letter provided by the Applicant’s mother. The letter was not dated or signed and contained no contact details and therefore the Tribunal placed little weight on it.  It considered that it did not overcome its concerns. The Tribunal also addressed the Applicant’s Refugee Convention claims relating to the general situation in Bangladesh in particular general instability and generalised violence as a result of the upcoming elections. The Tribunal had regard to country information in relation to increasing political violence in Bangladesh, but found that it did not appear to be targeted at Bangladeshi citizens who were not involved in politics.  The Tribunal found that the chance of the Applicant being harmed as a result of such generalised violence in Bangladesh was remote. The Tribunal concluded that, having considered the Applicant’s claims individually and cumulatively, it was not satisfied that there was a real chance he would suffer persecution because of his political opinion, religion or for any other reason if he returned to Bangladesh now or in the reasonably foreseeable future. The Tribunal considered the complementary protection criterion.  It referred to the fact that for the reasons given it had found the Applicant was not a credible witness and that it was not satisfied that he was involved with the BNP in Bangladesh, attacked, harassed arrested or threatened or that his family was harmed as a result of his political activities or that he was of any adverse interest to the authorities.  The Tribunal had regard to the Applicant’s activities and involvement with the BNP in Australia, but for the reasons given was not satisfied the Applicant engaged in those activities out of any genuine political beliefs.  The Tribunal also found that there was no evidence to suggest that the AL was aware of the Applicant’s involvement with the BNP in Australia or that, even if they were, this would result in him being of adverse interest to them.  The Tribunal was not satisfied that the Applicant had any genuine interest in the BNP or that he would be involved in any political activities if he were to return to Bangladesh.  It was not satisfied there were substantial grounds for believing that as a necessary and foreseeable consequence of the Applicant being removed from Australia to Bangladesh there was a real risk he would suffer significant harm. In addition, for the reasons discussed, the Tribunal was not satisfied that the Applicant had experienced significant harm in the past as a Hindu.  On the basis of country information before it the Tribunal was not satisfied that the Applicant met the criterion for complementary protection because of his religion. In relation to the Applicant’s claims about the family land, the Tribunal referred to the fact that for the reasons discussed it was not satisfied that the AL was trying to take over the family shop or land or would harm the Applicant in order to obtain the family land.  Hence it was not satisfied he met the complementary protection because of this claim. The Tribunal also recorded that, for the reasons discussed earlier in its reasons, it had found there was not a real chance the Applicant would be harmed because of generalised violence in Bangladesh for the same reasons the Tribunal was not satisfied there was a real risk the Applicant would be harmed because of generalised violence in Bangladesh. The Tribunal was not satisfied the Applicant was a person in respect of whom Australia had protection obligations under the complementary protection criterion. The Tribunal affirmed the decision not to grant the Applicant a protection visa. Current Proceedings  The Applicant sought review by application filed in this Court on 2 December 2013.  There are four grounds in the application.  The Applicant did not file written submissions prior to the hearing.  However when the matter came before the Court for hearing on 23 October 2014, he filed written submissions in Court addressing the grounds in his application.  In addition he raised, for the first time, a claim that during the second Tribunal hearing, he “challenged” the Tribunal to verify documents he had submitted (in particular those signed by BNP leaders) with the High Commission and also with the people who had signed the documents.  He claimed that the Tribunal had not responded to this “challenge”.  Notwithstanding that the Applicant had not filed a transcript of the Tribunal’s hearing, in these circumstances I considered it appropriate to allow the Applicant to tender the compact disc of the Tribunal hearing, provided he identified the part of the hearing in which he had the discussion with the Tribunal to which he referred.   Subsequently he filed an affidavit to which a compact disc was attached, which he said related to “Day 2 of the Tribunal hearing.”  He identified three occasions during the hearing on which he claimed he had asked the Tribunal to make an inquiry about the genuineness of his submitted documents.  As discussed below, I have considered whether this evidence supports any contention of jurisdictional error. At the resumed hearing parts of the hearing tape were played.  In the second part of the hearing relied on by the Applicant, the Tribunal informed the Applicant that while he had said (in the response to hearing invitation form) that he would like the Tribunal to take evidence by telephone from Mr Roy, the Tribunal member did not intend to do so, because she had no way of knowing to whom she was speaking.   However the Tribunal member also informed the Applicant that the Tribunal was aware that he had already provided a statement or letter from Mr Roy and that the Tribunal was happy to take any further statements or evidence (Transcript, p.47 at lines 44-47):  MEMBER: You have said here that you would like me to take evidence by phone from Mr Roy.  I don't intend to do that because I have no way of knowing who I’m speaking to.  So I know that you’ve provided a statement from him, or a letter from him, and I’m happy to take any further statements or evidence that you would like me to. The Tribunal member also informed the Applicant that if she was not going to make a positive finding based on evidence he had already provided, she would write him a letter which would give him an opportunity to submit any extra evidence (Transcript, p.47 at lines 34-35 and p.48 at lines 1-3):  MEMBER: I said at the beginning of the hearing that I don’t make decisions today.  So I want to take away all the evidence and consider it further. ...  ...  MEMBER: But, as I said, if I’m not going to make a positive finding based on evidence you’ve already provided then I will write to you a letter which will give you a date ... which will also give you an opportunity to submit any extra evidence. In light of the fact that the Applicant claimed the recording was of the second Tribunal hearing held on 4 November 2013 and the Tribunal decision was made on 7 November 2013 (without any intervening communication with the Applicant), I raised with the solicitor for the Minister the question of whether the Tribunal’s apparent failure to write to the Applicant after the second hearing was indicative of jurisdictional error.  The hearing was again adjourned.   Subsequently the solicitors for the First Respondent filed an affidavit of Ms Dejean affirmed on 27 November 2014 to which were annexed transcripts of the Tribunal hearings of both 12 August 2013 and of 4 November 2013.   When the matter came back before the Court, the Applicant accepted that such transcripts could be relied upon as an accurate record of what was said in English at each of the hearings. He acknowledged that the portions of the transcript identified in Ms Dejean’s affidavit as corresponding with the parts relied on by him were the relevant portions of the Tribunal hearings. I am satisfied on the basis of the evidence now before me, including the transcripts of the Tribunal hearings, that the hearing referred to by the Applicant, including the exchange in which the Tribunal undertook that it would write to the Applicant if it was not going to make a positive finding on the evidence before, was the first hearing which was conducted on 12 August 2013.   I note first that it is clear that after the first hearing the Tribunal did precisely what it said it would do, in that on 22 August 2013 the Tribunal wrote to the Applicant pursuant to s.424A of the Act, inviting him to comment on or respond to several items of information.   Furthermore, after receiving the Applicant’s response of 5 September 2013, the Tribunal invited him to appear before it for a further hearing to give evidence and present arguments relating to the issues arising in relation to the decision under review.  Thus the Tribunal gave the Applicant the opportunity referred to in the first hearing (Transcript, p.47).  No issue of possible jurisdictional error arises in this respect. Whether the Tribunal was under an obligation to make inquiries  After the First Respondent filed the affidavit to which the transcripts of the two hearings were annexed, the Applicant acknowledged that the issues he raised in support of the proposition that the Tribunal was under an obligation to make inquiries were based on what he said to the Tribunal during the first hearing.    The first part of the first hearing relied on by the Applicant in this respect is at p.45 of the Transcript of the hearing of 12 August 2013.  After the Applicant explained that he had provided evidence about Dr Yunus to demonstrate that he was from a rich, influential and popular family and knew Dr Yunus, the hearing continued (Transcript, p.45 at 24-34):  APPLICANT [THROUGH INTERPRETER]:   I am not a lowerclass person who is planning to come here.  So please consider the things.  I will verify the documents, and give me a decision.  MEMBER:   Country information states that fraudulent documents are very common on Bangladesh.  APPLICANT:  He is a – I mean, member of the standing committee of BNP.  This – that I was arrested by police.  I submitted this picture, and the newspaper incidents are there.  That was another case.  Then my sister died, but we ..... medical certificate.  That I was a general secretary, my ..... that – that I joined in Australia.  Also the letter that was here.  How many evidence do you need to prove that? The Transcript indicates that at line 25 the Applicant said, “I will verify the documents”. It is not clear why the Applicant would make such a remark.  It appears from the recording of the hearing that he may have asked “Please verify the documents and give me a decision”. The Applicant relied on this part of the hearing as an indication of an instance of a request to the Tribunal to verify documents.  However, at its highest, on the assumption that the Applicant did ask the Tribunal to “verify the documents”, this was no more than a generally expressed request.  The Applicant did not ask the Tribunal to make any particular inquiries. It is apparent from what the Applicant went on to say that his concern was the Tribunal’s consideration of the genuineness of the letters and other documents he had provided to establish his claims.  He asked the Tribunal, in effect, what evidence it needed “to prove his claims” after the Tribunal member had indicated to him that country information indicated that fraudulent documents were very common in Bangladesh (Transcript, p.45 line 34). It is the case that French CJ, Gummow, Hayne, Crennan, Kiefel and Bell JJ accepted in Minister for Immigration and Citizenship v SZIAI & Anor  (2009) 83 ALJR 1123;  [2009] HCA 39 at  [25] that:  ...It may be that a failure to make an obvious inquiry about a critical fact, the existence of which is easily ascertained, could, in some circumstances, supply a sufficient link to the outcome to constitute a failure to review... However there is no general duty to inquire (SZTKV v Minister for Immigration and Border Protection  [2014] FCA 903 at  [25]).  The circumstances of this case, including the exchange between the Applicant and the Tribunal set out above from p.45 of the Transcript of the first hearing, are not such as to establish that the Tribunal was under an obligation to make inquiries to “verify” the genuineness of all the supporting documentation submitted by the Applicant as appears to be contended.  The Tribunal was not obliged to accept the genuineness of such documents.  The circumstances before the Tribunal were not such as to indicate that there was a critical fact, the existence of which was easily ascertained, such that the Tribunal’s failure to make inquiries about the existence of that fact constituted a failure to review.  Insofar as the Applicant may have intended to suggest that the Tribunal should have made or instituted calls to the persons whose telephone numbers were shown on letters of support, as in SZIAI at [26], the question of whether such documents contained false statements (for example, about the Applicant’s involvement in the BNP) “would not be able to be determined by calls placed to those telephone numbers”.  Moreover the Tribunal gave the Applicant the opportunity to provide further statements or evidence from any witnesses (including Mr Roy) or other additional evidence after the first Tribunal hearing.  It had raised with him its concerns, including about the genuineness of his documents, inconsistencies in his evidence and the credibility of some of his claims. Having regard to the numerous significant issues of concern in relation to inconsistencies and implausibility in the Applicant’s claims it was open to the Tribunal to place weight on the adverse view which it reached in relation to the Applicant’s oral and written account of his claims and to place no weight or little weight on the supporting documents, finding that they did not overcome the Tribunal’s concerns (see SZTKV at [24] – [25]).  This exchange at the Tribunal hearing is not indicative of jurisdictional error, or such as to give rise to an obligation on the part of the Tribunal to inquire, either considered alone or in conjunction with the other parts of the hearing discussed further below. The second part of the first hearing relied on by the Applicant in support of the proposition that he asked the Tribunal to make inquiries is at p.48 of the Transcript.  The Applicant responded to a question from the Tribunal as to whether he wanted to say “anything”.  In order to understand his response, it is relevant to set out the prior remarks of the Tribunal (at Transcript p. 47, line 34 to Transcript p. 48, line 14) in which the Tribunal indicated it would write to the Applicant after the hearing if it had concerns and addressed the issue of taking telephone evidence from Mr Roy.  As outlined above, the Tribunal stated:  MEMBER:  I said at the beginning of the hearing that I don’t make decisions today.  So I want to take away all the evidence and consider it.  I do have some concerns about some inconsistencies in your evidence. Um, and also the credibility of some of some of the claims, for example, about the age that you became Joint Secretary and your role within the BNP.  Um, what that means is that one of two things will happen after the hearing.  If having reviewed the evidence I think that I can make a positive finding, then you will just receive my decision.  If I still have some concerns then I will write to you in a letter inviting you to comment on certain.... And following your answers to those concerns I will make my decision.  You have said here that you would like me to take evidence by phone from Mr Roy.  I don’t intend to do that because I have no way of knowing who I’m speaking to.  So, um, I know that you’ve provided a statement or a letter from him. And I’m happy to take any further statements or evidence you want me to.  But as I said if I am not going to make a positive finding based on evidence you have already provided then I will write you a letter which will give you a date which will also give you an opportunity to submit any extra evidence.  Did you want to say anything?The Applicant relied on his response (at Transcript p.48, lines 6-14), which was:   APPLICANT (through interpreter):  The inconsistency that you are talking about I may be wrong or made mistake in stating that the documents I gave... that I’m going to doctor for my physical things... and for nine months I’m taking medicine. I cannot say all I want to say. That maybe some inconsistencies are because I cannot remember things.  My documents are maybe... I give evidence inconsistent because when I think about my family and my situation... I get myself lost, I’m not in myself.  And there today I’m seeing that I’m losing my memory...Day after day I see that I am losing my memory.  ...he is senior vice chairperson of the BNP, because his mother is the prime minister – was the prime minister. Contrary to the Applicant’s submission, there is nothing in this part of the transcript to indicate that the Applicant asked the Tribunal to make any enquiries about the genuineness of his submitted documents.  Nor does this exchange support any contention that the Tribunal’s failure to make inquiries supplied a sufficient link to the outcome to constitute a failure to review.   For the sake of completeness, I note that insofar as in this part of the Tribunal hearing the Applicant raised his medical condition and the fact that he had been taking medicine, in its reasons for decision the Tribunal accepted that the Applicant was on medication and suffering from a depressive mental condition which may have affected his ability to concentrate, but did not accept that this could explain the particular concerns it had detailed in the decision.  Beyond those matters referred to in its findings and reasons, the Tribunal drew no adverse conclusions from other inconsistencies put to the Applicant in the s.424A letter and at the hearings.  I also note that when asked if he was on medication that may affect his evidence, memory or concentration at the first hearing the Applicant had indicated (Transcript, p.6) that he had not taken any medication that day.  There is no claim or evidence that the Applicant was not fit to participate in either hearing.      I have also considered the fact that the Applicant had, in his Response to Hearing Invitation Form, given written notice that he wanted the Tribunal to take evidence from Mr Roy (see s.426(2) of the Act).   The Tribunal was not required to obtain such evidence, but must have regard to the Applicant’s wishes (s.426(3)).  In accordance with the principles considered in Minister for Immigration and Citizenship v Li & Anor  (2013) 249 CLR 332;  [2013] HCA 18 the Tribunal must exercise such discretion reasonably.     The exchange in the first hearing shows that the Tribunal had regard to the Applicant’s wishes.   The Tribunal Member explained that she did not intend to take oral evidence by telephone on the number provided (as the Applicant suggested) as she had no way of knowing to whom she was speaking.  However she expressed a willingness to take any further statements or evidence from Mr Roy.   Moreover, the Tribunal subsequently advised the Applicant, through his migration agent, that if he was proposing that a witness give evidence at the second hearing, he should provide a witness statement setting out the witness’ evidence by a specified date and if a witness was unable to adopt or sign such a proposed witness statement, particulars of the evidence the witness was expected to address and how it was relevant to the case should be provided by that date.   In this way the Tribunal addressed the Applicant’s concern that it had not tried to take evidence from Mr Roy at the first hearing.  It has not been established that it acted unreasonably in exercising its discretion in this regard.  It considered the request.  There was an evidence and intelligible justification for the approach it took.  No failure to comply with s.426(3) of the Act has been established. The Applicant did not provide any further written submission or supporting statutory declaration.  Nor did he make any further request to the Tribunal to take evidence from any witnesses or provide any witness statement or particulars.  The Applicant attended the second hearing on 4 November 2013.  No issue is now taken by the Applicant with anything said or done by the Tribunal at the second hearing.  The last part of the transcript relied on by the Applicant is on p.48 of the Transcript of the first Tribunal hearing of 12 August 2013 (at lines 34-40).  This exchange occurred after the Applicant, in further response to the Tribunal’s invitation to him to “say anything”, provided what appeared to be intended to be an explanation for how he had obtained the position of Joint Secretary in the BNP and held that position from 2005 to 2011, including while he was living in South Korea (Transcript p.48, lines 12-34). In this context, the Applicant referred to other people who had obtained positions of influence through connections. He claimed he was very active from a young age and eventually in a good position, so he easily obtained the position.  He claimed that if you had money in Bangladesh people would give you extra importance. He also claimed that for the last ten years there had been no elections and that the same committees had existed.  The Applicant then explained (Transcript, p.48 at lines 32-38):  City council, chairman member, there were last five years and new five years.  There was no formation of new committee and as a result, I continued, and I also gave financial support to the party while I was...so kindly consider my situation.  I may be mistaken in one or two places, but please consider my situation, and deeply research the things and if you have any doubt you can – if you cannot call – or do not want to call...you can use somebody from your embassy and talk about me and ask about me, and then if you don’t trust me... (Emphasis added)  The Tribunal then asked the Applicant’s adviser if there was anything he wanted to say.  In response, the adviser referred to the fact that the Applicant had submitted documentation about his role in the BNP and took issue with independent country information in relation to the existence of fraudulent documents in Bangladesh.   He also provided an explanation about Bangladeshi legal proceedings in support of the Applicant’s claim that he had been arrested.  He addressed the political situation in Bangladesh.  This part of the Transcript does provide some support for the Applicant’s contention that he asked the Tribunal to make an inquiry.  However he referred generally to the fact that the Tribunal could call or use someone from the Embassy to “ask about” him.  Contrary to his submissions he did not ask the Tribunal to verify documents, whether with the signatories or otherwise. The Applicant did not ask the Tribunal to institute a specific inquiry through the Embassy or High Commission or to make an inquiry to a particular organisation or to any particular person.  It is clear that the Tribunal did not undertake to make any inquiries.   I have considered whether this exchange, together with the other evidence before the Court, including the other parts of the Transcript relied upon by the Applicant, is such as to establish that the Tribunal fell into jurisdictional error by failing to make an inquiry about a critical fact, the existence of which was easily ascertained. The Applicant’s request that the Tribunal consider his situation, notwithstanding that he may be mistaken in one or two places and deeply research things, and his suggestion that if the Tribunal had any doubt it “can use someone from [the] embassy to talk about [him] and ask about [him]” was not such as to give rise to an obligation on the Tribunal to embark upon an inquiry through an Australian High Commission or Embassy about him or as to whether the documents submitted by him or his claims were genuine or not (SZTKV at [25]).   The Tribunal rejected the Applicant’s credibility for reasons relating to matters other than the genuineness of his supporting documents.  It has not been established that there was a critical fact “the existence of which is easily ascertained” with a sufficient link to the outcome that the Tribunal’s failure to inquire could be said to constitute a failure to undertake the statutory duty of review or that it was otherwise unreasonable in the sense referred to in SZIAI at [26].  It has not been established that the Tribunal fell into error by failing to make inquiries. More generally, the Tribunal brought to the Applicant’s attention its concern about his claim to be Joint Secretary within the BNP in Bangladesh.  While the Tribunal member had indicated that she was not prepared to telephone the telephone number the Applicant had provided for Mr Roy (as she would have no way of knowing to whom she was speaking), the Member had also addressed issues of procedural fairness in her indication that she would raise issues of concern with the Applicant after the hearing and would give him the opportunity to provide further statements or evidence (whether from Mr Roy or extra evidence of some other form).  As outlined above, the Tribunal sent a s.424A letter to the Applicant and gave him the opportunity to provide evidence from witnesses at a second hearing. Having regard to all of the circumstances, in particular the generality of the Applicant’s suggestions to the Tribunal, the absence of identification of the manner in which any critical fact could be easily ascertained and the absence of any undertaking by the Tribunal to inquire, I am not satisfied that the Tribunal failed to make an obvious inquiry about a critical fact the existence of which was easily ascertained, or, as was described in SZTKV at [25] per Siopis J, that it failed to make a “simple inquiry which [was] open to make” such as to constitute jurisdictional error. Moreover in its reasons for decision the Tribunal set out its concerns in detail, including inconsistencies about when the Applicant’s claimed involvement with the BNP began; the lack of plausibility in his claim that he was appointed Joint Secretary at a time when he was studying full-time in high school and before the time he claimed to have started being very active in the BNP; and whether it was credible or plausible that he had been able to continue in the role as Joint Secretary after he left Bangladesh and lived in South Korea from 2006 to 2011.  The Tribunal made comprehensive adverse credibility findings based on the concerns it detailed.  It was open to it to place weight on its adverse view of the Applicant’s inconsistent and implausible evidence and to place little weight on documentary evidence intended to support his claims (SZTKV at [24]). The grounds in the Application  Ground 1 in the Application is a contention that the Tribunal failed to assess the Applicant’s credibility in terms of the Act.  The Applicant submitted that the Tribunal failed to maintain an open mind or to be mindful of the issues raised in the material before it when undertaking its assessment of the credibility of his claims.  In particular, it was submitted that the Tribunal’s s.424A letter made it apparent that the Tribunal had made up its mind.   The part of the Tribunal’s s.424A letter relied on in this respect referred to the fact that at the departmental interview the Applicant had described his brother and sister as being older than him (contrary to their birth certificates and the dates of birth provided).  When the delegate questioned him about why he would describe his younger brother as his older brother, he had stated that this was because the brother was described as his older brother in the file (and it was a slip of the tongue).  The s.424A letter continued:  The information above is relevant to the review because in your written statement you describe your brother and sister as being older than you but the birth certificates and dates of birth provided show that they are younger.  Your statement at the Departmental interview suggests that your brother is not the age you have described.  It is also relevant because the Tribunal does not accept that you would incorrectly describe your brother as being elder to be consistent with a mistake in your written application. The Applicant’s written submission in this respect mirrors the response to the s.424A letter.  It was submitted that the Tribunal’s statement that it “did not accept” the reason the Applicant gave for incorrectly describing his brother as being older (to be consistent with a mistake in his written application) indicated that the Tribunal had already made up its mind. In addition, in oral submissions the Applicant took issue with the fact that he had submitted various documents to the Tribunal and that the Tribunal had failed to accept his claims. He also submitted that the fact that the Tribunal decision was made only four days after the second Tribunal hearing indicated that the Tribunal had already made up its mind. An allegation of bias must be distinctly made and clearly proved.  In this case it has not been established that there was actual bias in the sense of prejudgment on the part of the Tribunal so committed to a conclusion already formed as to be incapable of alteration whatever evidence or arguments may be presented (see Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Jia Legeng (2001) 205 CLR 507;  [2001] HCA 17 at  [69] and [72]).  Nor is apprehended bias, considered from the perspective of the hypothetical fair-minded lay person properly informed as to the nature of the proceedings, the matters in issue and the conduct said to give rise to an apprehension of bias established (see Re Refugee Review Tribunal & Anor; Ex parte H & Anor (2001) 75 ALJR 982;  [2001] HCA 28 at  [28]).  It is notable that, consistent with the wording of s.424A of the Act, the s.424A letter commenced by explaining to the Applicant that the letter was an invitation to comment on or respond to certain information which the Tribunal considered would, “subject to [the Applicant’s] comments or response”, be the reason or part of the reason for affirming the decision under review.  It explained that the Tribunal had not made up its mind about the information. The Tribunal’s reference to the fact that it “does not accept” the explanation previously provided by the Applicant for describing his younger brother as his older brother was an explanation for the Tribunal’s credibility concerns about the information on which the Applicant’s comment was invited.  In isolation, it was not such as to establish either actual or apprehended bias. Moreover, after the Applicant responded to the s.424A letter (again explaining that he made a slip of the tongue when he tried to say that his brother was younger, that there was a typing mistake in his protection visa application and pointing out that to correct this mistake he had provided all of his siblings’ birth certificates to the Tribunal) the Tribunal invited the Applicant to a second hearing and gave him the opportunity to provide additional evidence.   In its reasons for decision, not only did the Tribunal not rely on this aspect of the information put to the Applicant in the s.424A letter or its concerns about his explanation, in its reasons for decision the Tribunal accepted that no witness’s evidence would be entirely consistent and that the Applicant was on medication and suffered from a depressive mental condition which may have affected his ability to concentrate on occasions.  The Tribunal drew no adverse conclusions from inconsistencies other than those detailed in its reasons for decision.  This would include this particular aspect of the information put to the Applicant for comment.   Insofar as a more general allegation of bias is made by the Applicant on the basis of the Tribunal’s failure to accept his claims in circumstances where he provided corroborative evidence, it is for the Tribunal to assess the evidence provided and to give such weight to that evidence as it considers appropriate.  In this case the Tribunal gave detailed reasons for rejecting the Applicant’s claims and for placing little weight on documents he provided that were intended to corroborate his claimed activities in Bangladesh. The Tribunal considered all of the documents provided by the Applicant.  It placed little weight on some documents.  It found that others did not relate to the Applicant’s protection visa claims or did not overcome its concerns in relation to the Applicant’s credibility.  The Tribunal was of the view that medical certificates did not provide any history about injuries, or opinion as to what caused injuries, or evidence as to the nature or severity of the injuries and in light of this placed no weight on them in support of the Applicant’s claims to have been attacked in Bangladesh.  It accepted the veracity of the letter of support from the convenor of the BNP in Australia, but noted the limitations on what was contained in that letter and the fact that the writer had only known the Applicant since his arrival in Australia. The Tribunal’s approach to the Applicant’s credibility, on the basis of detailed inconsistencies and implausibility in aspects of the Applicant’s evidence, involved findings that were reasonably open to it for the reasons that it gave on the material before it.  The Applicant’s disagreement with the Tribunal’s conclusions on the basis that he provided documentary evidence in support of his claims is not such as to establish either actual or apprehended bias, whether considered alone or in conjunction with the other issues that he raised.  Ground 1 is not made out. Ground 2 in the Application is that the Tribunal was “influenced by an opinion that fraudulent documents are available in Bangladesh”. The Applicant submitted that he was the subject of a false case filed against him.  He made submissions in relation to the activities of the regime in Bangladesh and what was said to be its practice of filing false cases in relation to central and district leaders.  He contended that the false case against him was an integral part of his claim which the Tribunal had failed to consider.   Insofar as this is a contention that the Tribunal failed to consider an integer of the Applicant’s claims, it is not made out. The Tribunal considered the Applicant’s claims that he was arrested at a cricket match and also that he was charged following events at the BNP Conference in April 2011.  The fact that the Tribunal did not accept that there were false charges outstanding against the Applicant in Bangladesh or that he was arrested at the cricket match does not mean that it failed to consider those claims. This ground was expressed as a concern that the Tribunal relied on country information which suggested that forged or fraudulently obtained documents were readily available or prevalent in Bangladesh.  The Tribunal did have regard to such information and also to information about the extent of corruption in Bangladesh.  On this basis it placed little weight on various documents provided by the Applicant in support of his claims.  However the weight to be given to particular items of country information is a matter for the Tribunal (see NAHI v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs  [2004] FCAFC 10).  It was open to the Tribunal to take the approach that it did on the material before it. The Tribunal closely analysed the various aspects of the Applicant’s claims.  It gave detailed reasons for its failure to accept aspects of those claims relevant to his claim to have a well-founded fear of persecution.  The Tribunal considered all the information before it.  It did not simply make its decision based on the fact that it gave little weight to certain documents provided by the Applicant.  It found that these documents did not overcome its concerns about inconsistencies and implausibilities in the Applicant’s evidence. Such an approach is not indicative of jurisdictional error.  Ground 2 is not made out. Ground 3 in the Application is that the Tribunal failed to consider the application on the basis of the Applicant’s claim to fear harm because of his Hindu religion.  In submissions the Applicant reiterated his claims to be a member of the minority Hindu community and contended that his community was subject to oppression by the Muslim community and that the Tribunal had made an error in considering this issue. Contrary to the Applicant’s assertion, the Tribunal clearly considered his claim to fear harm on the basis of his Hindu religion, both in the context of assessing the Refugees Convention and complementary protection criteria.  The Tribunal accepted that Hindus were a minority group in Bangladesh who had experienced some harassment, but had regard to country information to the effect that this harassment was not solely attributable to religious belief or affiliation, but normally had political or economic dimensions.  Moreover it found that the Applicant himself had not suffered serious harm in the past as a Hindu and concluded that there was not a real chance that he would suffer such harm now or in the reasonably foreseeable future if he returned to Bangladesh and also that he did not meet the complementary protection criterion.  Insofar as the Applicant seeks merits review, merits review is not available in this Court.  Ground 3 is not made out. Ground 4 in the Application is as follows:  The tribunal accepted that I was in favour of BNP.  However, the tribunal failed to assess my claims that as my involvement with the BNP, I may face adverse situation on my return to Bangladesh.  The Applicant contended that the Tribunal had accepted that he had been involved with the BNP in Australia and participated in meetings and demonstrations.  He submitted he was a “leading activist” and that the Tribunal had made an error in not considering him as a member of the Australian section of the BNP.  In addition, it was contended that the Tribunal had erred in failing to consider the Applicant as a member of the BNP in Bangladesh and in failing to “admit” the oppression towards the BNP in Bangladesh.    The Tribunal did accept that the Applicant had become involved with the BNP in Australia.  However it had regard to the absence of information in the letter of support from the convener of the BNP in Australia in relation to the role the Applicant played or how active he was in BNP in Australia.  It also had regard to the Applicant’s evidence at the first hearing about his activities, including his statement that he did not do much in Australia for the BNP, he did not hold a position with the BNP in Australia, and that his family was not aware of his activities in Australia.  The Tribunal considered this evidence and did not accept that there was any evidence before it to suggest that the Applicant’s activities in Australia would be known by the AL in Bangladesh or would cause him any difficulties.   It was open to the Tribunal to find, having regard to its findings in relation to the Applicant’s credibility and lack of political involvement in Bangladesh, that the Applicant’s involvement with the BNP in Australia was solely for the purpose of strengthening his claim to be a refugee within the meaning of the Refugees Convention. It disregarded that conduct for the purpose of assessing the Refugee Convention claim.  However, in the context of considering complementary protection, the Tribunal had regard to and considered the Applicant’s activities and involvement with the BNP in Australia.  It was not satisfied he had engaged in those activities out of any genuine political beliefs, that the AL was aware of his involvement in Australia or that even if they were, this would result in him being of adverse interest to them.  It did not fail to consider the Applicant’s claims in relation to the BNP in Australia.  This aspect of ground 4 is not made out.   Insofar as it was submitted that the Tribunal failed to consider whether the Applicant was a member of the BNP in Bangladesh or the consequences of such membership, the Tribunal addressed the Applicant’s claims in relation to his activities and involvement in Bangladesh.  For the detailed credibility reasons that it gave it was not satisfied that the Applicant was involved with the BNP in Bangladesh, that he held any position with the BNP or that he experienced the incidents in Bangladesh he relied on in support of his claims.  In circumstances where the Tribunal did not accept that the Applicant was involved with the BNP in Bangladesh, it was not necessary for it to go on to consider the treatment of persons who were involved with the BNP in Bangladesh.  Ground 4 is not made out.  As none of the grounds relied on by the Applicant are made out, the Application must be dismissed. I certify that the preceding one hundred and twenty-four (124) paragraphs are a true copy of the reasons for judgment of Judge BarnesAssociate: Date:  29 July 2015       \",\n",
       " 'SZTQS v Minister for Immigration & Border Protection & Anor [2015] FCCA 978 (4 June 2015)': \"  This is an application pursuant to s.39B of the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth) and Pt.8, Div.2 of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) (“the Act”) for judicial review of a decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal dated 6 November 2013 and handed down on that date (“the RRT”). The applicant claims to be a citizen of Sri Lanka and of Tamil ethnicity, who fears harm from the authorities in Sri Lanka. Prior to considering the proceeding before this Court, these Reasons provide the relevant procedural background, a summary of the legislative framework, a summary of the applicant’s claims made in support of his application for a protection visa, a summary of the decision of a delegate of the first respondent (“the Delegate”), and a summary of the RRT’s review and decision. Background  The applicant arrived in Australia on 29 June 2012 as an unauthorised maritime arrival, having departed illegally from Sri Lanka on a passport issued in his own name. On 29 August 2012, the applicant undertook an Irregular Maritime Arrival Entry Interview. The applicant was subsequently granted a bridging visa and released from detention on 16 October 2012. On 9 November 2012, the applicant lodged an application for a protection (Class XA) visa with the Department of Immigration and Citizenship (“the Department”). On 13 February 2013, the applicant had an interview with an officer of the first respondent with the assistance of a Tamil interpreter. On 8 March 2013, the Delegate refused the applicant’s application for a protection visa. On 15 April 2013, the applicant lodged an application for review of the Delegate’s decision by the RRT.  On 6 November 2013, the RRT affirmed the decision of the Delegate not to grant a protection visa.  On 11 December 2013, the applicant filed an application in this Court seeking judicial review of the RRT’s decision. Legislative framework  Pursuant to s.65(1) of the Act, if satisfied of a number of matters, the first respondent may grant a visa. Section 31(1) of the Act provides that there are to be prescribed classes of visa.  One class of visa is a Protection (Class XA) visa (reg.2.01 of the Migration Regulations 1994 (Cth) (“the Regulations”) and Schedule 1 to the Regulations). Section 36(2) of the Act relevantly provides that a criterion for a protection visa is that an applicant is a non-citizen in Australia in respect of whom the Minister is satisfied that Australia has a protection obligation under the Refugees Convention as amended by the Refugees Protocol. Section 5(1) of the Act defines “Refugees Convention” and “Refugees Protocol” as meaning the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees and 1967 Protocol relating to the Status of Refugees (“the Convention”).  Article 1A(2) of the Convention relevantly defines a refugee as a person who:  “owing to a well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion, is outside the country of his nationality and is unable or, owing to such fear, unwilling to avail himself of the protection of that country; or who, not having a nationality and being outside the country of his former habitual residence, is unable or, owing to such fear, is unwilling to return to it.” Section 91R of the Act expands on the notion of persecution and serious harm when considering Article 1A(2) of the Convention. Section 36(2)(aa) of the Act provides that:  “(2)  A criterion for a protection visa is that the Applicant for the visa is:  (aa)  a non-citizen in Australia (other than a citizen mentioned in paragraph (a)) in respect of whom the Minister is satisfied Australia has protection obligations because the Minister has substantial grounds for believing that, as a necessary and foreseeable consequence of the non-citizen being removed from Australia to a receiving country, there is a real risk that the non-citizen will suffer significant harm.” Sections 36(2A) and 5 of the Act define “significant harm.” Under s.411(1)(c) of the Act, a decision to refuse to grant a protection visa is a decision which may be reviewed by the second respondent. The requirements of the natural justice hearing rule are exhaustively stated in Division 4 of Part 7 of the Act (s.422B(1) of the Act).  Division 4 Part 7 includes ss.424A and 425, which provide that:  “424A Information and invitation given in writing by Tribunal   (1)  Subject to subsections (2A) and (3), the Tribunal must:  (a)  give to the Applicant, in the way that the Tribunal considers appropriate in the circumstances, clear particulars of any information that the Tribunal considers would be the reason, or a part of the reason, for affirming the decision that is under review.     425  Tribunal must invite Applicant to appear  (1)  The Tribunal must invite the Applicant to appear before the Tribunal to give evidence and present arguments relating to the issues arising in relation to the decision under review.” Section 424AA of the Act permits the RRT to give orally to an applicant clear particulars of any information that the RRT considers would be the reason or part of the reason for affirming the decision under review. The RRT must ensure that the applicant understands the relevance of the information and the consequences of any information being relied upon. The RRT must also invite the applicant to comment on or respond to the information and advise the applicant that the applicant may seek additional time to comment on or respond to the information. Under s.474(2) of the Act, a decision of the second respondent is a 'privative clause decision'.  Under s.474(1)(a) of the Act, a privative clause decision is final and conclusive. However, a purported decision of the second respondent which is affected by jurisdictional error is not a decision which is made under the Act and therefore is not a privative clause decision (see Plaintiff S157/2002 v Commonwealth (2003) 211 CLR 476). The applicant’s application for a protection visa  The applicant claimed to have suffered past harm at the hands of the police and the Sri Lankan Navy, arising from his fishing activities. The applicant claimed that on 25 May 2012 he was arrested and detained for 2 days. He was released upon payment by his mother of his bail money. The applicant claimed that by reason of his Tamil ethnicity he feared he would be arrested or harmed upon his return, and that failed Sri Lankan asylum seekers were detained upon re-entry and suffered serious harm constituted by detention in dire prison conditions. The applicant also claimed that he feared he would be targeted because of his Tamil ethnicity and because of a perception that he was associated with the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (“the LTTE”). The Delegate’s decision  The Delegate found that the applicant’s claims for protection were not credible because his claims of past persecution at the hands of the police had not been mentioned in his entry interview and that his evidence in relation to these claims was vague and unconvincing. The Delegate accepted that the applicant had been harassed by the Sri Lankan Navy as claimed and accepted that he had been involved in a neighbourhood dispute. The Delegate found that, on return to Sri Lanka, the applicant may suffer some discrimination by reason of his ethnicity but that such discrimination would not amount to serious harm. The Delegate found that the chance of any harm befalling the applicant upon return to Sri Lanka as a failed asylum seeker was remote. Accordingly, the Delegate refused the applicant’s application for a protection visa on the basis that the applicant is not a person to whom Australia has protection obligations under the Convention and that the applicant does not meet the alternate complementary protection criterion. The RRT’s review and decision  On 15 April 2013, the applicant lodged an application for review of the Delegate’s decision by the RRT.  On 5 August 2013, the RRT wrote to the applicant informing him that the RRT had considered the material before it but was unable to make a favourable decision on that material alone. The letter invited the applicant to attend a hearing on 29 October 2013 to give oral evidence and present arguments.  On 22 October 2013, the applicant’s legal representative lodged a submission in support of the applicant’s claims, which detailed, inter alia, country information as to the ill-treatment of failed asylum seekers upon re-entry to Sri Lanka. On 29 October 2013, the applicant and his legal representative attended the RRT hearing and the applicant gave evidence with the assistance of a Tamil interpreter. The RRT did not accept the applicant’s claims to have experienced past Convention-related serious harm.  The RRT did not accept that the applicant was arrested and detained on 25 May 2012 as claimed, or that he was required to attend court for any reason.  The RRT found that the applicant had not suffered any persecutory harm in Sri Lanka because of his Tamil ethnicity and that he would not be imputed with a political opinion sympathetic to the LTTE, or opposed to Sri Lankan authorities. The RRT was not satisfied that the applicant would suffer any differential treatment to other returned asylum seekers or that there was a real chance of persecution by reason of being a returned asylum seeker. The RRT also found that the applicant would not suffer differential treatment for a Convention reason because he left Sri Lanka illegally. The RRT was not satisfied that the applicant faced a real risk of being arbitrarily deprived of his life, the death penalty being carried out on him, being subjected to torture, being subjected to cruel or inhumane treatment or punishment, or being subjected to degrading treatment or punishment for any reason or as a necessary or foreseeable consequence of him being removed from Australia to Sri Lanka.  Accordingly, having determined that the applicant did not satisfy the refugee criterion in s.36(2)(a) of the Act, or the alternative criterion in s.36(2)(aa) of the Act, the RRT affirmed the decision under review.  The proceeding before this Court  The applicant was represented before this Court by Mr Ben Mostafa, of counsel.  Counsel for the applicant confirmed that the applicant relied on only one of the grounds contained in his application for judicial review, filed 11 December 2013. Counsel confirmed that the applicant did not rely on any other ground. The ground is as follows:  “The Tribunal failed to comply with s 425(1) of the Act.  Particulars  The Tribunal found that the applicant “may be placed in the remand section of Negombo prison” and would remain there “until a bail hearing is available”: [46]  The Tribunal said that bail “is routinely given”, but qualified that statement by finding that “a family member is also required to provide surety”: [46]  The Tribunal concluded that “the prospect of the applicant being detained for a prolonged period of time [is] remote” and probably only “a few days”: [51], thereby implicitly concluding or assuming that someone would be able and willing to provide the surety required for the applicant’s bail. It was only on that basis that the Tribunal could have concluded that the applicant would be released after a few days.  The “issues arising in relation to the decision under review” therefore included whether the applicant or his family or someone else would be able and willing to provide the surety required for the applicant’s bail so as to cause him to be released from the overcrowded prison.  The Tribunal’s conclusion or assumption that the applicant or his family or someone else would be able and willing to provide the surety required for the applicant’s bail was “adverse” to the applicant and was “not obviously ... open on the known material”: SZBEL v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2006] HCA 63;  (2006) 228 CLR 152 at  [29], citing Commissioner for ACT Revenue v Alphaone Pty Ltd [1994] FCA 1074;  (1994) 49 FCR 576 at 591-592.  The Tribunal did not give the applicant “the opportunity of ascertaining” that issue or the opportunity “to be informed of the nature and content of adverse material” in relation to that issue: SZBEL v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2006] HCA 63;  (2006) 228 CLR 152 at  [32].” It is common ground that the RRT accepted that, because the applicant had left Sri Lanka unlawfully, he would be arrested upon his return and would need to obtain bail before being released. The relevant finding of the RRT is as follows:  “Under recently tightened procedures those returnees who are believed to have left the country in breach of Sri Lanka’s laws on immigration and emigration are arrested at the airport and brought before a court to apply for bail. Bail is routinely given on the accused’s own recognisance although a family member is also required to provide surety. If the arrival occurs over a weekend or on a public holiday the returnee is placed in the remand section of Negombo prison and may remain there for some days until a bail hearing is available.” I accept that a crucial plank in the RRT’s reasoning in relation to whether the applicant would obtain bail was that a member of the family of the applicant would provide surety for him. It is also common ground that the RRT never raised this issue with the applicant expressly. Counsel for the applicant contended that, in failing to raise that issue with the applicant, the RRT committed jurisdictional error in that it failed to comply with s.425(1) of the Act. Counsel for the applicant contended that the RRT failed to give the applicant a sufficient opportunity to give evidence or make submissions about an issue arising in relation to the decision under review. That issue was whether the applicant had a family member who could provide surety for the applicant to ensure his release on bail.  Further, counsel for the applicant contended that the RRT failed to give the applicant the opportunity to respond to an adverse conclusion that was not obviously open on the known material. That adverse conclusion was that the applicant had a family member who would provide surety for the applicant to ensure his release on bail. In considering complementary protection, the RRT made the following findings:  “The Tribunal accepts that the applicant may be remanded in prison for a few days in conditions which are cramped, uncomfortable and unpleasant. The Tribunal accepts that returnees are only reported to be held in remand if they illegally departed Sri Lanka and for a short duration of a few days while waiting to be brought before a court to apply for bail, which is routinely given.” I accept counsel for the applicant’s submission that the RRT had concluded that the applicant would be granted bail and that it was therefore unnecessary for the RRT to proceed to consider whether the prospect of a longer stay in prison might have entitled the applicant to complementary protection. I also accept counsel for the applicant’s submission that the RRT’s reasons clearly show that the conclusion that the applicant would be granted bail was based on the RRT’s acceptance that a member of the applicant’s family would be needed to provide surety for the applicant. Counsel for the first respondent’s submissions were based on a contention that the applicant had a reasonable opportunity before the RRT hearing on 29 October 2013 to make a claim that he would suffer harm in prison in Sri Lanka and that his family were impecunious and therefore unable to assist him in making bail. Counsel for the first respondent submitted that on the applicant’s own evidence, his mother had previously paid bail for him upon his detention in Sri Lanka and that his parents had financially supported him when he was unemployed. Counsel for the first respondent submitted that it was open to the RRT to conclude that the applicant’s family could pay surety for the applicant’s release should he be detained for leaving Sri Lanka illegally and that such a conclusion was not a conclusion not obviously open on the known material in the manner referred to in Commissioner for Australian Capital Territory Revenue v Alphaone Pty Ltd [1994] FCA 1074;  (1994) 49 FCR 576 (“Alphaone”). However, the RRT rejected the applicant’s claims of having been detained before, including that his family had paid his bail to release him from detention. It is well established that the issues that arise in relation to the decision under review are to be identified by the RRT. If the RRT takes no step to identify some issue other than those the Delegate considered dispositive and does not tell the applicant what that other issue is on review by the RRT, the issues arising in relation to the decision under review will be those that the original decision-maker identified as determinative against the applicant (see: SZBEL v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] HCA 63;  (2006) 228 CLR 152 at  [35], as per the Court (“SZBEL”)). The Court in SZBEL referred to Gummow J in Somaghi v Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs [1991] FCA 389;  (1991) 31 FCR 100 (“Somaghi”), where the Court may require the applicant to have the opportunity to deal with matters adverse to the applicant’s interests which the decision-maker proposes to take into account. In SZBEL at [29], the Court cited Alphaone at 591-2 as follows: “Where the exercise of a statutory power attracts the requirement for procedural fairness, a person likely to be affected by the decision is entitled to put information and submissions to the decision-maker in support of an outcome that supports his or her interests. That entitlement extends to the right to rebut or qualify by further information, and comment by way of submission, upon adverse material from other sources which is put before the decision-maker. It also extends to require the decision-maker to identify to the person affected any issue critical to the decision which is not apparent from its nature or the terms of the statute under which it is made. The decision-maker is required to advise of any adverse conclusion which has been arrived at which would not obviously be open on the known material. Subject to these qualifications however, a decision-maker is not obliged to expose his or her mental processes or provisional views to comment before making the decision in question.”   The only relevant reference to bail upon the applicant’s return to Sri Lanka in the transcript of the RRT hearing is as follows:  “MEMBER: So I need to assess... the credibility of that claim but, where there...where a person is returned and they are...suspected of having departed illegally, what the information generally reports is that, depending on the day that they return, if there is an intervening weekend or a public holiday, the person can be held for either a few hours or one or two days, before they're then taken to the court to apply for bail.  It seems that bail is routinely given and then the returnees go back to their life and then they have to reappear in court to discuss the substantive issues of having... of having left... of having left Sri Lanka illegally.  And...  Just let me finish...overwhelmingly the information indicates that when people do appear in relation to those charges, they're...the penalty that they are given is a fine.  Now, I need to consider that information...but is there anything that you want to say in relation to it?”  (emphasis added) The applicant’s response was that he would not get bail because he would be suspected of escaping to some other country, so would therefore be put in gaol.  Counsel for the first respondent referred to various exchanges between the RRT Member and the applicant relating to his family’s sources of income, however, there is no evidence to suggest definitively that the applicant’s family was a family of wealth. There is no exploration by the RRT with the applicant specifically of the overall financial position of his family. Indeed, the applicant’s evidence as to where the money came from to pay for a boat to take him to Australia was that his mother borrowed money from people. Counsel for the first respondent does not suggest that whether a family member of the applicant was able to provide surety was a matter that was expressly raised with the applicant by the RRT. Counsel for the first respondent relies on a submission that there was every opportunity provided to the applicant to make such a claim about his family’s impecuniosity that no such claim was made and that the RRT’s implicit conclusion that the applicant’s family would be able to provide surety for him was open to it on the material before the RRT. I do not accept the first respondent’s submissions. As stated above, critical to the RRT’s finding that the applicant could apply for bail and that bail was routinely given was a finding that a family member is required to provide surety. In those circumstances, it was plainly an issue for the RRT that the applicant’s family would be able to provide surety for him in order that he may obtain bail. That was not an issue before the Delegate and, in the circumstances, it became an issue for the RRT. The RRT was required to raise it with the applicant for the applicant to have an opportunity to address that finding by the RRT, which was adverse to him.  Accordingly, the RRT failed to accord the applicant procedural fairness as required by s.425(1) of the Act. A fair reading of the decision that a family member must pay surety to effect bail for the applicant was an issue solely named by the RRT and which it failed to identify to the applicant. Section 425(1) of the Act requires the RRT to invite the applicant to appear before it to give evidence and present arguments relating to the issues arising in relation to the decision under review. The issue of whether a family member was required to pay surety to enable the applicant to be bailed was not an issue before the Delegate and was not an issue raised by the applicant. It is an issue arising from the finding of the RRT that the applicant’s family were required to pay surety to enable the applicant to be granted bail.  Further, on the evidence and material before the RRT, there is nothing to suggest that the applicant or his representative should have been aware that the ability of the applicant’s family to pay surety to enable him to be granted bail was a determinative factor in the mind of the RRT Member.  Further, I accept counsel for the applicant’s submission that the RRT’s conclusion that the applicant had such a family member was a conclusion that was critical to the RRT’s decision and was not a conclusion that would obviously be open on the known material. In considering whether the applicant met the complementary protection criterion, the RRT concluded that the applicant was not at risk of serious harm as a failed asylum seeker upon return to Sri Lanka because he would be detained only for a few days while waiting to be brought before a court to apply for bail, which is routinely given. Implicit in that finding is that because bail is routinely given, it will be given to the applicant. However, the RRT made the clear finding that the applicant’s ability to be granted bail was dependent on a family member being able to provide surety. As stated above, that was an issue that the RRT was obliged to raise with the applicant and its failure to do so is a denial of procedural fairness and a breach of s.425(1) of the Act. Accordingly, the matter should be remitted to the RRT for determination according to law. I certify that the preceding sixty-seven (67) paragraphs are a true copy of the reasons for judgment of Judge Emmett Associate:  Date:  4 June 2015        \",\n",
       " 'SZTUT v Minister for Immigration & Anor [2015] FCCA 2978 (6 November 2015)': '  This is an application made pursuant to s.477(2) of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) (“the Act”) on 23 January 2014 seeking an extension of the time set out in s.477(1) of the Act, such as to make a competent application pursuant to s.476 of the Act, seeking review of the decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal, now the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, (“the Tribunal”) made on 12 June 2013 which affirmed the decision of the Minister’s delegate to refuse a protection visa to the applicant. The applicant, with legal representation, sought to amend the grounds of the proposed substantive application on 7 May 2014 and again subsequently on 20 April 2015. On both occasions the applicant appeared to have abandoned the application to extend time pursuant to s.477(2) of the Act by indicating that he did not wish to make that application.  Section 477(1) of the Act, provides that applications made pursuant to s.476 of the Act, which seek to engage the Court’s jurisdiction to review migration decisions, must be made within 35 days of the date of the migration decision. In the current case, that decision was made by the Tribunal on 12 June 2013, the application for review pursuant to s.476 of the Act was filed over six months late on 23 January 2014. It was, therefore, not competent. Section 477(2) of the Act does provide for the exercise of the Court’s discretion to extend time if it is in the interests of the administration of justice to do so. However, s.477(2)(a) of the Act requires an application for an extension of time to be made in writing, specifying why the applicant considers it necessary for the Court to extend time. In the current case, by the filing of the purported substantive “amended” application on 7 May 2014, the applicant indicated that he did not apply for an extension of time. No grounds in support of any such extension were provided. At that point, therefore, the question arose as to whether there was any application in writing for the extension of time as required by s.477(2)(a) of the Act. This is particularly so given there was no specification by the applicant as to why it was in the interests of the administration of justice to extend time as also required by s.477(2)(a) of the Act. The purported further amended substantive application on 20 April 2015 again indicated that the applicant did not make an application to extend time. That proposed substantive application, however, was supported by a ground regarding an extension of time, notwithstanding the indication that the applicant did not make an application for an extension of time. This was in the following terms:  “I applied for a protection visa on the 8 September 2012. The Department of Immigration and Border Protection refused my application on the 19 December 2013. I applied for the Refugee review Tribunal for review of the delegates’ decision. During, this period, I was represented by Vrachnas Lawyers, that they cannot assist me further. As a result of that, I do not know anything and what to do next. During that time I was desperate to know my options. I had no idea what to do after the refusal of the RRT. I approached a solicitor he advised me to lodge Ministerial appeal. He did not give me option to go to Courts. He charged me put do not want to put his name in the Ministerial appeal. I relied on him and he said the Minister will intervene in my case. I really relied on him because he said he is a lawyer who had handled many immigration cases. He did not at any time either orally or in writing inform me about the option to go to Court. He did not seek any counsel’s advice to see whether my case has any merit. He insisted me to apply to the Minister. I was misguided by this person which deprived me the right to judicial review. I strongly believe due to that I was deprived of my right to challenge the decision. Some elders in the community and Christian pastors told me that I should have gone to the courts before going to the Minister. I strongly believe that my case has merits and I have outlined the reasons in my application.” Notwithstanding the difficulties above, the question of the extension of time was set down for hearing. At that hearing on 20 July 2015, leave was granted for the applicant to formally submit his application for an extension of time in writing. The Court proceeded on the extension of time application made on 20 July 2015. The grounds in support of the application for an extension of time were the same grounds as those as those supporting the 20 April 2015 application, as set out above at [7]. The evidence before the Court is contained in the bundle of relevant documents tendered by the Minister (“the Court Book” – “CB”) and the applicant’s affidavit of 19 July 2015 setting out his evidence in support of the extension of time. As I have previously stated, the elements relevant to any extension of time application are not exhaustive (SZNZU v Minister for Immigration & Anor  [2010] FMCA 197 at  [52] – [55]). However, as I identified in SZMFJ v Minister for Immigration & Anor [2009] FMCA 771 at  [44], some of the elements include the length of the delay, any satisfactory explanation for it and the merits of the grounds in the proposed substantive application. The Minister opposed the application for the extension of time. The basis for this was said to be the lack of merit in the grounds of the proposed amended substantive application. The Minister noted that the period of delay was significant. However, he did not take issue with the explanation provided by the applicant for this delay. Further, the Minister made no submission that he was prejudiced by the delay in making the application. The hearing for the extension of time, therefore, proceeded on the basis that the pre-eminent element in the consideration for the extension of time was whether the grounds of the proposed substantive amended application had any merit. Proposed Substantive Application  Although two grounds were pleaded in the ultimate proposed substantive application, the applicant only pressed ground two. Ground one was abandoned. Ground two is in the following terms:  “The RRT has failed to consider the full integers of the claim.  Particulars  In considering the Applicant’s claim under section 36(2)(aa) of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth), the RRT failed to aggregate the Applicant’s claim to have previously been suspected of having links to the LTTE and of possessing scars.” The ground directs attention to the Tribunal’s consideration in respect of the criterion at s.36(2)(aa) of the Act, and asserts that the Tribunal failed to consider the “full” integers of the applicant’s claim in relation to that consideration because it failed to consider, in an aggregate sense, the applicant’s claim to have been suspected of having links in Sri Lanka to the LTTE and to have (“possessing”) scars on his body. Background  The background to the applicant’s ground is as follows. The applicant is a citizen of Sri Lanka. He arrived in Australia by boat from Indonesia. Following the Minister’s intervention pursuant to s.46A(2) of the Act, he made an application for a protection visa on 8 September 2012 (CB 18 to CB 80). He was assisted by a registered migration agent. The applicant’s claims to fear harm on return to Sri Lanka were expressed, variously, in an interview he had with immigration officials on arrival, in a Statutory Declaration attached to his protection visa application, and in submissions made by his representative. There is no dispute that the applicant claimed to fear harm as a Tamil and because the Sri Lankan authorities suspected that he had links with Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (“LTTE”). The claim, therefore, was based on his Tamil ethnicity, and an actual or imputed political opinion, because of a perception that he was an LTTE supporter because he had worked and had travelled to northern Sri Lankan and had lived in a predominantly Tamil area. He further claimed to fear harm as a member of a particular social group being Tamils who had left Sri Lanka illegally and returned to Sri Lanka following unsuccessful claims for protection in Australia.  The applicant claimed to fear harm on return from police and security officials. He said that on return he would be interrogated and possibly tortured or killed during this interrogation. The Minister’s delegate refused the grant of the protection visa. The applicant applied for review to the Tribunal on 23 January 2013 (CB 123 to CB 129). He continued to be represented by a registered migration agent. The applicant attended a hearing before the Tribunal on 12 March 2013 (CB 138 to CB 139). In its decision record, the Tribunal set out the applicant’s claims to fear harm, as referred to above at [18] – [20], with the addition of expanded claims in relation to the description of membership of particular social groups. The Tribunal accepted that the applicant was a Tamil from Udappu in Sri Lanka. It noted that the applicant had provided “ambiguous and conflicting evidence”. Nonetheless, it accepted that he had worked as a fisherman between 2004 and 2012 including for one year in Trincomalee ([96] at CB 167). The Tribunal rejected the applicant’s claim that he would be suspected of being associated with the LTTE on return to Sri Lanka. This was based on the applicant’s own evidence that he had not provided evidence of the authorities suspecting him of any such links since 2009, and, further, if he had been of interest to the authorities after that time he would have experienced some difficulties in the years prior to his departure for Australia ([101] at CB 168 to [104] at CB 169). The Tribunal rejected the claim that he would suffer harm because he is a Tamil fisherman from Udappu and would therefore be perceived as an LTTE supporter ([105] – [107] at CB 169). The Tribunal also considered a claim, made by the applicant at the Tribunal hearing, that he would suffer harm because he would be unable to earn a livelihood as a fisherman ([108] at CB 169 to CB 170). The Tribunal found that the applicant would not suffer serious or significant harm on return because of his Tamil ethnicity. It had regard to country information regarding the security situation in Sri Lanka since the cessation of hostilities some years earlier ([109] at CB 170 to [114] at CB 171). The Tribunal found that the applicant would not, in the circumstances, be imputed with a pro-LTTE or anti-government political profile because of his ethnicity, or because of where he had come from in Sri Lanka ([115] at CB 171). The Tribunal also found that the applicant did not have the profile of a Tamil who was at risk from the authorities, or paramilitary groups, or Sinhalese generally ([116] at CB 171 to [120] at CB 172). The Tribunal also considered his claimed fear in the context of his claimed membership of various particular social groups. These included social groups said to arise from his having left Sri Lanka illegally and applying for asylum in Australia ([122] at CB 172 to [139] to CB 176). The Tribunal also considered the claim raised by the applicant’s representative in submissions that the applicant would face difficulties on return because he had scars ([120] at CB 171 to CB 172). The Tribunal noted that having left Sri Lanka illegally the applicant may be subject to certain sanctions. It found however that in the circumstances this would not amount to persecutory harm ([141] – [142] at CB 177). The Tribunal also considered the applicant’s claims as against the criterion at s.36(2)(aa) of the Act. It found he was not a person to whom Australia had protection obligations under this criterion ([145] at CB 178 to [154] at CB 179). Consideration: Proposed Substantive Application  In his written submissions, the applicant contends that the Tribunal is required to consider the entirety of the applicant’s claims (see references in the applicant’s submissions at [15] to Khan v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2000] FCA 1478 at  [31], W352 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2002] FCA 398, MZWPD v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2006] FCA 1095 at  [69], SZGUW v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship  [2008] FCA 91 per Jacobson J and SZGUW v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship  [2009] FCA 321;  (2009) 108 ALD 108 per Reeves J). There is no dispute with this proposition. He further contends that the Tribunal is required to consider these claims and component integers either made by an applicant or “apparent” on the face of the material before it (Htun v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs  [2001] FCA 1802; (2001) 194 ALR 244 (“Htun”) and Dranichnikov v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2003] HCA 26; (2003) 197 ALR 389). Again, no real dispute emerges. Further, the applicant relies on NABE v Minister for Immigration & Multicultural & Indigenous Affairs (No.2) [2004] FCAFC 263;  144 FCR 1 (“NABE (No 2)”) for the proposition that the Tribunal’s obligation to consider claims to protection is not limited to the expressly articulated claims, but on the basis of all the material before it. In light of this, the applicant explained his ground before the Court as follows. First, the applicant’s migration agent “squarely” raised an integer of the applicant’s claim to fear harm as being that “the fact he has scars” would “place” the applicant in “some difficulty” upon his return to Sri Lanka. The applicant directed attention to [94] of the Tribunal’s decision where he said the Tribunal recorded this claim (at CB 166):  “The applicant’s agent indicated that on his return that as the LTTE is part of the people smuggling racket, the CID may use this to establish he is an LTTE supporter as he left Sri Lanka illegally. She also submitted that he will face difficulty on his return as being suspected to be with the LTTE as he has scars, was in areas that used to be controlled by the LTTE and is a young Tamil man.” In dealing with the applicant’s claims under the complementary protection criterion (s.36(2)(aa) of the Act), the applicant directed attention to [145], [148] – [149] of the Tribunal’s decision record (at CB 178):  “[145] As reasoned above, the Tribunal is not satisfied that, at the time of his departure from Sri Lanka in May 2012 the applicant had any adverse profile giving rise to any risk of harm, including a real risk of significant harm, despite his claimed compounded risk profile.   ...  [148] As to his scar, while the Tribunal accepts he has such a scar, on the basis of the country information above it does not accept there is a real risk he will suffer significant harm on his return to Sri Lanka on this basis.  [149] The Tribunal notes that the applicant, should he return to Sri Lanka, would have the additional characteristics of being a returned failed Tamil asylum seeker and a person known or suspected to have breached Sri Lankan emigration and immigration laws, characteristics he did not possess when he was last in Sri Lanka.” The applicant submitted that in relation to what the Tribunal said at [148] (at CB 178), the country information to which it referred also included the following ([90] at CB 166):  “The British High Commission in Colombo has reported: ‘There is strong anecdotal evidence that scarring has been used in the past to identify suspects. Previous conversations with the police and in the media, the authorities have openly referred to physical examinations being used to identify whether suspects have undergone military style training. Contacts in government ministries suggest that this practice has either ceased or is used less frequently. At the very least it appears that the security forces only conduct these when there is another reason to suspect an individual, and are not looking for particular scars as such, but anything that may indicate the suspect has been involved in fighting and/or military training. There is no recent evidence to suggest that these examinations are routinely carried out on immigration returnees.’ (UK Border Agency 2012, Operational Guidance Note: Sri Lanka, April, at para 3.6.37)” The applicant’s argument was that at [148] (at CB 178), the Tribunal addressed the scarring issue “in isolation”. The applicant’s submission was that the “scarring” matter was not raised in isolation, but was raised as an integer of the applicant’s claim to fear harm. That is, that that fear arose from the “aggregate” of other matters advanced by the applicant. The applicant pressed that, as set out at [149] (at CB 178), the Tribunal accepted that there were “additional characteristics” in the “aggregate” of elements that were the basis of the applicant’s fear of harm (see above at [37]).  The applicant also submitted that yet further elements were identified by the Tribunal at [151] (at CB 178):  “Taking into account the information on unlawful or illegal departure above, while the Tribunal accepts that, as a person who departed Sri Lanka illegally, the applicant will be questioned by the Sri Lankan authorities at the airport and in consultation with his local police authorities, the Tribunal is not satisfied that he has any adverse profile which will be revealed throughout that process. While the applicant may have been questioned in 2009 as being suspected of being with the LTTE as a Tamil who travelled to the North East, for the reasons outlined above I have found he is no longer suspected of having had any such link, nor was he at the time of his departure and therefore the applicant will not be suspected of being with the LTTE on his return to Sri Lanka.” The applicant understood the Tribunal’s reasoning to be as follows. It accepted that the applicant had scarring. It found that given country information, to which it referred, this fact would not raise a real risk of significant harm if the applicant were to return to Sri Lanka. The applicant’s submission was that the other elements in the claim to fear harm were not taken into account by the Tribunal in rejecting that the fact of scarring would pose a real risk for the applicant. The applicant argued that the country information identified certain circumstances ([90] at CB 166) where searches would be carried out by the Sri Lankan authorities and, in that event, the applicant’s scarring would be discovered and he would face a real risk of significant harm, thereby engaging s.36(2)(aa) of the Act. The applicant’s attack also focussed on the second sentence at [151] (at CB 178, see above at [42]). The argument was that the finding expressed there was that the applicant would no longer be suspected of having LTTE links. This finding was made in the context of the Tribunal having found that the applicant would be questioned on return to Sri Lanka because he had left illegally. The complaint was that the scarring would be found during that process. The applicant’s argument was that the Tribunal did not address the scarring matter in the context of the applicant being questioned on return to Sri Lanka because of his illegal departure. The Minister agreed that the applicant’s claim to have scars, and that this had some bearing on his claim to fear harm, was “squarely” raised. In this regard, the Minister directed attention to the second dot point in paragraph [69] of the Tribunal’s decision record (at CB 158):  “...- All his fears may come to a reality on his return in terms of the authorities being suspicious of him as he has scars, was in areas controlled by the LTTE and is a young Tamil man. I noted it was not until after the war ended he went to Tricomlee. She responded that under interrogation it will be revealed that he travelled there and while the suspicion could be economic these matters could combine for them to think he is a LTTE supporter. As to his scar on his face, the applicant said he received it while playing when he was 17 or 18.”  The Minister emphasised that what is set out here was, on the evidence available, what was relevantly and squarely raised. In that light, it was important to note that there was no reference, nor can it be inferred, to any claim that the applicant’s scarring would bring him to any particular attention at the airport in Sri Lanka if the applicant was to be questioned there on return. The Minister’s position was that in that light, the Tribunal dealt with the claim as it was squarely raised. That is, that at [110] (at CB 170) the Tribunal dealt with the scarring matter, and as it related to the applicant’s return to Sri Lanka:  “In this regard I have considered his claim that he will be targeted if he returns to Sri Lanka as a Tamil and a Tamil from Udappu and as a young Tamil male with scars that and as a member of this ethnicity and groups he will be perceived as being with the LTTE. His agent submitted at the hearing that harassment as a Tamil can amount to ongoing fear and mental torture which could amount to persecution.” The Minister emphasised that there was no express claim made by the applicant that the scarring was linked to being questioned at the airport on return. Nor could such a claim be inferred from what the migration agent and the applicant told the Tribunal. The Minister also drew attention to the Tribunal’s findings at [116] – [117] (at CB 171) where the Tribunal rejected the proposition that the applicant had any profile that would bring him to the attention of the Sri Lankan authorities on return. Further, being a young Tamil male was not a factor that would lead to further harm for the applicant. The Minister submitted that in the context of this analysis, the Tribunal dealt with the matter of scarring in detail ([121] at CB 172):  “The applicant’s agent also indicated he will face difficulty on his return as he has scars and is a young Tamil man who visited LTTE areas and this will become known when he is questioned by the authorities on his return. As to the latter claims I have dealt with them above. As to his scarring the applicant claimed he received the scar from playing when he was 17 or 18. Despite being asked on numerous occasions at the hearing before me whether he had any other reasons for fearing return the applicant never raised his fear of return as he had scars or that he was targeted in Sri Lanka because of these scars, even though when he was questioned by the navy in 2009 in Tricomlee he had the scar. I expect if he feared return on this basis he would have claimed it before the hearing to the Department or Tribunal and that he would have faced difficulties as a result. As it was not raised I therefore do not accept that the applicant faced any difficulty in Sri Lanka because of the scar or fears return on this basis. Further country information from the British High Commission in Colombo outlined above has also reported that while there is strong anecdotal evidence that scarring has been used in the past to identify suspects, contacts in government ministries suggest that this practice has either ceased or is used less frequently. The High Commission notes that at the very least it appears that the security forces only conduct these when there is another reason to suspect an individual, and are not looking for particular scars as such, but anything that may indicate the suspect has been involved in fighting and/or military training and there is no recent evidence to suggest that these examinations are routinely carried out on immigration returnees. As I have found above he does not have such a profile, I do not accept he will be targeted on his return because of his scar. For these reasons and those above, I do not accept he has a well-founded fear of persecution on the basis of his scars or will face serious or significant harm on the basis of these, combined with his ethnicity and that he visited LTTE controlled areas were he to return in the reasonably foreseeable future.” It is important to note that, in developing his argument before the Court, the applicant made reference only to the Tribunal’s finding in relation to complementary protection (with some reference to country information referred to elsewhere in the Tribunal’s decision record). I accept the Minister’s submission that the Tribunal’s analysis, and findings in relation to complementary protection, should not be read in isolation of factual findings set out earlier in its decision record. As the Tribunal made clear at the beginning of its particular analysis on complementary protection ([145] at CB 178), it sought to refer to reasoning and findings expressed “above”. It was open to the Tribunal to proceed in this way. It was entitled to rely on factual findings expressed earlier, and did not need to repeat them (SZSGA v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs and Citizenship [2013] FCA 774 at  [56] per Robertson J). These “earlier” expressed findings were based in part on country information which included that, in the past, scarring was an integral factor, of itself, which engaged the authorities’ attention on persons who might have fought in the war, or had military training. However, that country information also stated that the circumstance of coming to attention simply because of possessing scars was a practice that had ceased or greatly diminished. In my view, on a fair reading, the import of this is reflected in what the Tribunal set out at [90] (at CB 166). In essence, the Tribunal’s reasoning was that what had been the situation in the past, was no longer the case, and was not relevant to the current situation in Sri Lanka. I agree with the Minister that the Tribunal’s reasoning and findings at [121] (at CB 172) must, plainly, be read in context of what it set out at [90] (at CB 166). If for no other reason than the Tribunal’s repetition at [121] (at CB 172) of the thrust of that country information makes it plain that the two paragraphs are to be read together. The Tribunal’s analysis at [121] (at CB 172) when read with, in particular [110] (at CB 170) and [116] – [117] (at CB 171), on at least a fair reading, is that the applicant did not have a profile, certainly at least from 2009, having regard to all the other factors he claimed would lead to harm, that would make his scarring a matter of concern for him upon return. That profile involved the characteristics of his ethnicity, having come from a former LTTE area, being suspected of involvement with the LTTE in the past, or that he had been involved in activities which brought him to the attention of the authorities. The aggregated claim that the applicant says was not considered by the Tribunal focusses, as set out above, on the proposition that the scarring would bring him to attention at the airport on return. As is made clear in such authorities as NABE (No 2), the Tribunal’s obligation is to deal with all claims and aspects of claims (Htun) expressly made or clearly arising in the circumstances as presented (see above). I agree with the Minister that the applicant did not raise such a claim on what was presented. The applicant’s relevant claim is as set out at [69] (at CB 158). That claim, and its component integers were addressed by the Tribunal. The Tribunal squarely addressed the “scarring” claim as it was put. It found, on the country information, that the matter of the scarring was not of consequence unless there existed some other factor, such as a particular profile or association with the LTTE. The Tribunal considered this and rejected it. Specifically, in relation to what would happen at the airport, the Tribunal’s finding was that any questioning of the applicant in the absence of any adverse profile, would not constitute, or lead to, significant harm for the applicant. I agree with the Minister that the “scarring” claim and what would occur at the airport, were not part of some express, or clearly arising, aggregation of the applicant’s total claims. The Tribunal considered each claim and each part of those claims as they were put or arose. Further, the applicant’s focus only on those paragraphs dealing specifically with complementary protection does not take into account the totality of earlier expressed findings made by the Tribunal and their relevance to the analysis on complementary protection. Even further, the applicant’s ground is answered when regard is had to [153] of the Tribunal’s decision (at CB 179). Its conclusion about complementary protection plainly was, as the Tribunal stated, derived from the applicant’s claims which it accepted and “considered cumulatively”. The applicant’s ground does not reveal jurisdictional error on the part of the Tribunal. Conclusion  Therefore, in relation to the Court’s discretion to extend time, the applicant’s ground cannot be said to be of sufficient merit, or character, such as to argue for the extension. The applicant’s ground was comprehensively argued by counsel. I did not understand there was anything further to be said about it by the applicant. In all, the application to extend time should be refused. I will make an order accordingly.I certify that the preceding sixty-six (66) paragraphs are a true copy of the reasons for judgment of Judge NichollsAssociate:  Date: 6 November 2015       ',\n",
       " 'SZTXH & Anor v Minister for Immigration & Anor [2015] FCCA 2508 (17 September 2015)': ' Introduction  The applicants are citizens of the People’s Republic of China (China). They seek judicial review of the decision of the second respondent (Tribunal) affirming a decision of a delegate of the first respondent (Minister) not to grant the applicants Protection (Class XA) visas (Protection visa). The first applicant (applicant) is the only applicant who made claims for protection. The second applicant, who is the applicant’s de facto partner, applied as a member of the family unit.     Claims for protection  In a statement that formed part of the applicant’s application for a Protection visa,[1] the applicant claimed to fear harm due to her political convictions, status as an unmarried mother, and difficulties faced due to the disability of the second applicant.  According to that statement, the applicant’s parents leased land on which they conducted a fishery and piggery business. In April 2006 the local village leader demanded shares in the applicant’s family business. Her parents refused, and in response the leader ordered that the piggery be demolished. That occurred in May 2006. The applicant’s father “tried to resist” and was “beaten very badly”.  In October 2006 the applicant’s parents were again targeted by the leader, who ordered a “staged” car accident. The applicant’s parents recognised the driver as someone who was involved in the demolition of the piggery. As a result of the accident the applicant’s mother suffered a concussion and broken leg, and her father was badly bruised. The actions of the leader caused her parents to worry about the applicant’s safety and they arranged for her to leave and study in Australia.  After she left China, the applicant’s parents informed her they “were persecuted harder”. In December 2008 the applicant’s mother was assaulted by the nephew of the leader and was hospitalised. In February 2009 the leader ordered the fishery be closed. When the applicant’s parents resisted they were reported to the local government, who decided that they needed to be “punished”. Police were then sent to evict them and demolish the fishery. The applicant’s father tried to appeal the leader’s decision to the government. While awaiting a response the leader “used his power to torture and persecute” the applicant’s father. Subsequently the applicant’s parents lost hope that their appeal would be successful and, fearing for their safety, they decided to give up the fishery in February 2011 without compensation. The applicant’s parents now live in poverty, “misery and fear” following the destruction of their business by the leader. They are in debt and homeless despite their attempts to appeal the leader’s decisions to the government. The applicant was pregnant when she applied for a Protection visa. The applicant claimed to fear persecution if she were to return to China because her child would be born out of wedlock. The applicant also claimed she feared that she would be forced to undergo an abortion, would be fined, and the child would be unable to be registered. The applicant provided to the Tribunal documents confirming she was pregnant with her second child.[2] The applicant also provided a letter from her psychologist, who confirmed the applicant’s pregnancy and stated she was suffering “severe depression and anxiety symptoms due to the constant worrying of her residency application”.[3] The applicant also claimed she and her children would be harmed and unable to sustain themselves if they returned to China due to the second applicant’s physical disability. The applicant submitted a photograph of the second applicant’s hands and a medical certificate which stated he is prevented from performing heavy duties or lifting.[4] A certificate in Chinese was also submitted, which the applicant asserted recorded his disability and exempted the second applicant from military service.[5]  Tribunal’s reasons  While the Tribunal accepted that the applicant’s parents had built and operated a fishery and piggery on land leased from the local government, it was not satisfied “as to the truth of the Applicant’s claims concerning harm suffered by her family”.[6] The Tribunal relied on the following matters: The applicant “produced no substantiation of her claims about the harm done to her family by local officials or village elders beyond six photographs”.[7] The applicant claimed the photographs depicted the business before and after destruction, but the Tribunal was of the view that they failed to demonstrate that the same business belonged to the applicant’s parents.  The applicant did not provide any documents evidencing the applicant’s parents’ dispute with the local leader, or the appeals to the government.[8] The Tribunal considered it was implausible that local officials would demolish the applicant’s parent’s business only to then build and operate another fishery and piggery in its place.[9] The applicant’s family had the ability to raise money that was necessary to arrange for the applicant to travel to and study in Australia. That cast further doubt on the applicant’s claim that her parents lost a major part of their business in May 2006 and were deeply in debt.[10] The applicant’s claims regarding the current circumstances of her family were vague and implausible.[11] The applicant’s claims about her father’s petitioning activities were vague and inconsistent.[12] The Tribunal accepted that the applicant had one child who was born in Sydney and was expecting a second child and that this would be in breach of the family planning regulations in China.[13] While the Tribunal accepted that the applicants, as holders of “rural household registrations”, would be subject to a fine, it found the fine would be relatively small and would be “payable in instalments”.[14] Further, given it did not accept the applicant’s claims about her parents’ circumstances in China, the Tribunal did not accept that the applicant would lack the “support of her own family if she were to return to China”.[15] The Tribunal was also not satisfied the applicant would be unable to seek support from the second applicant’s family.[16] Further, although the Tribunal accepted that the applicant had been “diagnosed as suffering from depression and anxiety”, and that the second applicant “has a medical condition which prevents him from engaging in heavy physical labour”, the Tribunal was not satisfied that, on their return to China, these conditions would prevent the applicants from finding employment.[17] The Tribunal, therefore, was not satisfied “that there is a real chance” that the applicants would suffer serious harm “simply because they were required to pay fines imposed on them for the breach of China’s family planning regulations”.[18] The Tribunal accepted there have been cases of “forced sterilisations and abortions in China”.  The Tribunal, however, was not “satisfied that this practice occurs with such frequency that there would be said to be more than a remote chance that the application would be subjected to a forced abortion”. [19] The Tribunal also accepted that the second applicant may be limited by his medical condition in the kind of employment he may be able to find in China.[20] However, there was nothing to indicate the second applicant had suffered any discrimination in China because of his condition; and the second applicant had achieved a level of education in China which enabled him to meet the requirements for a Student visa.[21] The Tribunal, therefore, was not satisfied that he would face a real chance of serious harm or that he does, in fact, have a well-founded fear of persecution if he were to return to China.[22] The Tribunal concluded that neither applicant were persons in respect of whom Australia has protection obligations pursuant to s.36(2)(a)  of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) (Act). Because the Tribunal was not satisfied that the applicant’s family was ever subjected to harm through the loss of their business to corrupt government officials, or that her father has ever been harmed for petitioning or that the applicant herself would petition the authorities, it found the applicant did not satisfied s.36(2)(aa) of the Act and was not a person to whom Australia has protection obligations. Grounds of application  The application contains four grounds of review. The first is:  In the RRT decision, the first section of paragraph 24 mentioned that, except for the photographs, I did not provide any other materials. Because the local government forced us to give up our business with illegitimate approaches, which directly caused large losses on us. It was impossible for us to get proper documentations such as the demolition certificate. In addition, the documentations and materials we used to have for the appeal have been confiscated and destroyed by the government.  This ground raises no jurisdictional error by the Tribunal. It is a submission to explain why the applicant did not have documents which the Tribunal considered the applicant ought to have had available, if the applicant’s claims were true. At the hearing before me, the applicant, who is not legally represented, said that she did not inform the Tribunal that the government had confiscated documents; but that was because the Tribunal did not ask the applicant. The Tribunal made no jurisdictional error by not asking the applicant whether she had any documents that supported her case. It was for the applicant to put material before the Tribunal in support of her case.  The applicant also submitted that there were no documents in relation to the destruction of the applicant’s parents’ business because it was done illegally. Again, this submission discloses no jurisdictional error; it goes to the merits of the claims the applicant presented to the Tribunal, and which the Tribunal did not accept. In any event, the Tribunal accepted that formal documents such as demolition orders, demands for the resumption of land, or demands for the termination of the lease might not have existed if the applicants’ family were subjected to demands which had no legal basis. What was significant for the Tribunal, however, was that the applicant did not produce documents which might reasonably be expected to have been prepared by the applicant’s father if he had, in fact, made efforts to petition the authorities against the resumption of the leased land.[23] The second ground stated in the application is:  Referring to the 4th section of paragraph 24, RRT could not understand the reason why the relatives would like to demolish our home. It actually the same thing in Australia, to the bank, houses are valuable; to the relatives, destroying our home, making us homeless was their way to revenge. This ground does not disclose any jurisdictional error. It is a submission that goes to the merits of the claim the applicant made to the Tribunal. At the hearing before me, the applicant only said that the “relatives just felt comfortable to demolish our house and made us homeless”. This submission does not add anything to the ground stated in the application.  Ground 3 is as follows:  [The second applicant’s] health has been in a bad condition (Disability certificate has been handed in). [The second applicant] is unable to do any heavy work. It means, if we go back to China, we definitely will be persecuted, it’s very likely [second applicant] will not survive. By then, I will become a single mother without any income, and have to wander from place to place to hide myself from the persecution. These facts have never been considered by the RRT.  The Minister submits that this ground contains a claim which the applicant did not make before the Tribunal, and which could not reasonably be taken to have arisen on the material that was before the Tribunal. That claim is that, because the second applicant will be unable to work, the applicant will become a single mother without any income and, for that reason, will suffer persecution. I agree that the applicant made no such claim; and that no such claim can reasonably be taken to have been made or to have arisen from the material that was before the Tribunal. In any event, even if such claim can reasonably be taken to arise from the material, the claim would have been necessarily premised on the elements of a claim the applicant made, and which the Tribunal did not accept. The claim is that the applicant would be unable to pay the social compensation fee because the second applicant was disabled, and that the applicant could not afford to pay the fee, even by instalments, because the applicant could not support herself.[24] The Tribunal rejected that claim because the Tribunal was not satisfied the applicant would lack support from the applicant’s family or from the second applicant’s family; and the Tribunal was not satisfied that, notwithstanding the second applicant’s having a medical condition which prevents him from engaging in heavy physical labour,  the applicants “if they were to return to China they would be unable to find employment of some kind and establish themselves as, presumably, many millions of other young couples do each year”.[25]  Thus even if the applicant claimed persecution because she would be without a wage due to her partner’s inability to work, all the essential factual elements of such claim, bar facing persecution, were not accepted by the Tribunal, and thus would inevitably have failed had the Tribunal considered such claim. The only submissions the applicant made to me in support of ground 3 was to ask why the applicant and her family cannot remain in Australia because they have settled in Australia, and to say that she wanted to remain in Australia for the sake of the health of her children. These are not matters that are relevant to whether the Tribunal made any jurisdictional error. The fourth ground stated in the application relies on the first three grounds. It states that the “above suggests RRT’s lack of fairness to me”. Unfairness by itself, however, is not a recognised ground of jurisdictional error.  On my review of the transcript of the hearing before me when I was considering my reasons, I noticed I did not specifically have ground 4 interpreted to the applicant and ask her to make submissions in relation to that ground. I do not now recall whether I did that consciously because the ground wholly relies on the other three grounds. I did, however, both at the beginning and end of the hearing invite the applicant to make submissions in relation to her application. In any event, I caused to have the matter listed before me at 2.15 pm on 14 September 2015 for the purpose of having ground 4 interpreted to the applicant and inviting the applicant to make submissions on that ground. A letter dated 25 August 2015 was sent by the Court to the applicants notifying them of the listing of the matter before me at 2.15 pm on 14 September 2014 and the purposes of the relisting. The letter was posted to a post office box address provided by the applicants.  The applicant appeared by telephone at the hearing on 14 September 2014. The applicant informed me that she did not receive the letter dated 25 August 2015 because she has not checked her post office box. She nevertheless said she was prepared to proceed with the hearing. All four grounds were interpreted to the applicant. I did not invite the applicant to make submissions in relation to the first three grounds; but I did invite her to make submissions in relation to the fourth. The applicant repeated the substance of her claims for protection. She submitted that both her children are young; the second applicant cannot work in the construction industry; and that she would face fines if she returns to China. The applicant also submitted that she and the second applicant would make a useful contribution to Australia. None of these matters, however, suggest any jurisdictional error by the Tribunal.  The applicant also submitted the Tribunal failed to consider that the applicant would be subjected to fines if she returned to China. I do not accept that submission. As I have already noted, the Tribunal accepted the applicant would be subjected to a fine but it was not satisfied there was a real chance that the applicants would suffer serious harm simply because they would be required to pay fines for breaching China’s family planning regulations. Finally, the applicant submitted before me that the hearing before the Tribunal took place over two sessions because, at the first session, the interpreter had to leave before the hearing was completed. This is not a matter raised in the grounds of application. In any event, that the Tribunal hearing was not completed in one session does not by itself suggest the Tribunal made any jurisdictional error. Disposition  I propose to order that the application be dismissed, and that the applicant pay the Minister’s costs. I also propose to order that the Administrative Appeals Tribunal be substituted for the Refugee Review Tribunal as the second respondent.I certify that the preceding twenty-eight (28) paragraphs are a true copy of the reasons for judgment of Judge ManousaridisAssociate:  Date: 17 September 2015 [1] CB37-38[2] CB111-112[3] CB112[4] CB130[5] CB129[6] CB171, [25][7] CB167, [24], first dot point[8] CB 167-168, [24], first dot point[9] CB168, [24], second dot point[10] CB168, [24], third dot point[11] CB168, [24], fourth dot point[12] CB169, [24] fifth dot point[13] CB170, [29][14] CB170, [32], [33][15] CB171, [34][16] CB171, [34][17] CB171, [34][18] CB171, [34][19] CB171, [36][20] CB172, [39][21] CB172-173, [38][22] CB172, [39][23] CB167-169, [24], first dot point[24] CB164-165[25] CB171, [34]       ',\n",
       " 'SZUCJ & Ors v Minister for Immigration & Anor (No.2) [2015] FCCA 3266 (18 December 2015)': ' Introduction  The applicants, a husband, wife, and their child, are citizens of Pakistan, and Sunni Muslims. They seek judicial review of a decision of the second respondent (Tribunal) affirming the decision of a delegate of the first respondent (Minister) not to grant the applicants Protection (Class XA) visas (Protection visa). The matter was first listed for hearing before me on 29 October 2014. On that day the applicants, who at the time were not legally represented, applied for an adjournment to give them an opportunity to obtain legal representation. I refused that application.[1] I granted the applicants leave, however, to file an application in a case to reopen their case by 28 January 2015, and I ordered that if no such application were made by that date I would consider the hearing concluded and give judgment based on the evidence adduced and the submissions made at the hearing on 29 October 2014. In the event, on 28 January 2015 lawyers representing the applicants filed submissions in support of an application for leave to reopen the applicants’ case, together with a draft amended application and submissions in support of the grounds set out in the draft amended application. By consent, I directed the Minister file submissions in response. At the request of the applicants, I listed the application for leave to reopen for hearing on 17 September 2015. On that day I heard submissions on three questions: whether I should grant the applicants leave to reopen their case; assuming I grant the applicants leave to reopen their case, whether I should grant the applicants leave to file an amended application; and, if leave to amend the application were granted, whether the Tribunal made the jurisdictional errors claimed in the proposed amended application.  Before I consider these issues, it will be necessary to set out the applicants’ claims for protection, and the Tribunal’s reasons for not accepting them. The applicants’ claims for protection  The alleged facts on which the applicants claimed protection were first set out in a detailed statement contained in their application for Protection visas.[2] The alleged facts are as follows. In 2008 the first applicant (the husband) worked in a bank in Lahore. He countersigned documents that had been prepared by a fellow employee that were later found to have been fraudulent. The husband also received a four-page “charge sheet”.[3] That was a letter from the bank to the husband in which it alleged the husband had engaged in gross misconduct in relation to the husband’s involvement in his fellow employee’s frauds, and required the husband to respond to the allegations.[4] By a subsequent letter, the bank imposed “punishments” in relation to the matters alleged in the charge sheet.[5] These were the “[s]toppage of increment and Bonuses for the year 2008” and the “[i]ssuance of a Letter of Reprimand”.[6] To salvage his career at the bank, and to stop his financial position from deteriorating, the husband and the second applicant (the wife) “joined the Shia sect on 08 October 2008” because “they control the promotions in” the bank.[7] In support of that claim, the husband and the wife provided two documents, one purportedly signed by the husband,[8] and one purportedly signed by the wife.[9] The document purportedly signed by the husband certified that “on 08-10-2008” “[h]e changed his sect from Sunni to Shia”, and the document purportedly signed by the wife certified that “on 08-10-2008” “[s]he changed his [sic] sect from Sunni to Shia”.   After the husband and the wife changed to the Shi’a sect the husband’s “career was salvaged and my salary was restored and my bonuses, allowances and increments were immediately restored”.[10] The husband supported this claim with what he described to be a letter from the bank.[11] That letter, which is dated 13 March 2010, stated that the husband’s “services have been confirmed in Bank with effect from 17th August 2006 [sic], subject to the usual terms and conditions”. The husband supported his claims with additional letters from the bank stating that his salary had been increased.[12] After converting to the Shi’a sect life for the husband and the wife greatly improved. The husband and the wife, however, intended to return to the Sunni community “when the time was right”; and they did so “by breaking off our relationships with the Shia mosque by not attending the Mosque for worship or prayers”.[13] The husband and the wife began to receive threatening, abusive, and harassing telephone calls and threatening letters because “we converted back to the Sunni sect”.[14] Articles also appeared in “the Pakistani and English language newspapers advising that we have converted back to the Sunni sect which would identify where we live and who I work for and my work location”.[15] On one occasion, when walking across a road outside their house, a car sped by from nowhere and nearly knocked over the husband. This was done to intimidate the husband.[16] On 17 June 2010 the husband received a threatening letter stating “[w]e have come to know that you have converted from being a believer in Fiqah-e-Jafaria to become a Sunni” and “[y]ou have not done any good to yourself by doing this”.[17] The letter stated the husband was being monitored “by the system” and warned him that if he did not return to the fold of Fiqah-e-Jafaria “we will make you, your son and your wife to learn a lesson”, including “even go to the extent of killing all three of you”.[18] The husband also received a letter dated 28 September 2010 stating “we had previously forbidden you to mend your ways but you did not listen to us”, and “we will teach a lesson for converting to ‘Sunnism’”.[19] In October 2010 the wife was present at a Shi’a religious procession during “on or about the tenth day of Mohoram [sic]” where devotees were whipping themselves. A man approached the wife, and said that the third applicant (the child), who was then 1 year and eight months old, was old enough to whip himself.[20] The man insisted the child do so, and “go and touch the horse”.[21] In response the wife declared the husband and the wife were not Shi’a and the child, therefore, was not obliged to whip himself. The man told the wife she and the husband had taken a lot of benefits from joining the Shi’a community and they will have to pay.[22]  Although not stated in the husband’s application, before the Tribunal the applicants claimed that in October 2010 the applicants converted back to the Sunni faith by engaging a solicitor to prepare documents declaring that the husband and the wife had returned to the Sunni sect. Those documents were lodged with a court, sent to the Shi’a community, and their contents published in a newspaper.[23] On 10 October 2010 the husband was attacked by four or five persons who jumped out of a car at a roundabout. One of the attackers had a gun which he used to intimidate the husband, and the persons bashed the husband until he passed out.[24] The husband reported the incident to police.[25] The husband then received another threatening letter.[26] The husband believed that, once he left for Australia, the Shi’a “will not see me and they will forget us”.[27] After the husband arrived in Australia in February 2011, however, the wife received a letter dated 16 May 2011 [sic] which stated that “[w]e have come to know” that the applicant “has fled to Australia”, and now it was the wife’s turn.[28] Out of concern for the wife’s safety, the husband advised the wife to go to Dubai and reside with her mother.[29] The wife went to Dubai in February 2011 [sic], but could only stay there for three months, so she returned to Pakistan on 12 May 2011.[30] On 24 May 2011 some four or five male persons broke into the husband’s and the wife’s home in Pakistan and violently bashed the wife with sticks and terrorised the child.[31] The wife was treated at the hospital,[32] and she made a complaint to the police which was recorded in writing.[33] To cope with the danger, the wife and the child moved around and resided with relatives for two or three weeks.[34] The husband decided it would be best to bring the wife and child to Australia; and they arrived in Australia on 27 January 2012. The threats in Pakistan, however, did not stop. The husband’s father received a letter dated 4 February 2012. It stated that the husband and the wife “may go to whatever place on earth, we will not spare them”, and that the husband and the wife will be chased “until they re-join Fiqah-e-Jafaria”.[35] That was followed by a letter dated 15 June 2012 to the husband’s father, this time threatening the father.[36] The husband stated:[37]  From the chronology above it is obvious that our situation has become worse over time since returning to the Sunni sect. If our situation was not so dangerous to live in Pakistan we would return after I complete my studies. However, the situation in Pakistan is intolerable and will lead to my wife and son and I being bashed, raped and killed so we are asking for protection of Australia and so a protection visa. Before the Tribunal On 12 December 2013 the husband and the wife appeared before the Tribunal to give evidence and present arguments.[38] In addition, the husband and the wife presented a witness (Mr S) who had also prepared a statutory declaration dated 2 December 2013.[39] The Tribunal summarised the effect of the evidence Mr S gave as follows:[40]  Mr [S] is a national of Pakistan who came to Australia in June 2012 as the holder of a student Visa. He claimed that he was a customer of the bank where the applicant worked and met him by that means. He claimed that in October 2010 while walking on the street he saw a number of men assaulting the applicant (as the applicant had claimed occurred once he converted back to the Sunni sect).  He heard the attackers say words to the effect that the applicant had to return to the Shi’a sect. After this incident he saw the applicant at the bank and the applicant told him about his conversion between the two sects. He said that he and a friend took the applicant to hospital to treat his injuries. There is in evidence the statutory declaration made by Mr S.[41] It includes the following statements: (1) I know [the husband] as a teller in . . . Bank at . . . Lahore Pakistan. (2) I know him from when he worked at . . . Bank at . . . Lahore Pakistan. . . .  (5) I know that [the husband] was a member of the Sunni sect and converted to Shia sect and he after some time converted back to Sunni sect. (6) I witnessed [the husband] being bashed near the round about near the marketplace in Lahore in October 2010 due to that he converted back to Sunni sect. (7) I witnessed some 4 or 5 men bashing [the husband] and they said that he has insulted them for joining the Shia sect then converting back to Sunni sect and that he better convert back to Shia sect otherwise they will bash him and kill him. (8) A friend that was with me at the time and I took [the husband] to the . . . Hospital after the bashing as he was hurt. There is in evidence a transcript of the evidence Mr S gave before the Tribunal. That evidence included the following:[42] TM: So what happened? W: I was with a couple of friends because it was one of my friends birthday.  W: So we were celebrating as there are many restaurants in that area  W: Saw when saw him there, there was a lot of crowd W: So like there were 5 people there. W: and they attacked him TM: So did you see the people attacking [the husband] W: I saw but there was a lot of crowd and it was night time. TM: So what, you just saw a little bit, what was that? W: I saw that they had sticks their hand W: And one of them had a gun, the big one W: So like they said you insulted our religion and degraded it. W: So we wont leave you like this TM: Did they say what he had done to insult his religion? W: It was something similar to saying that you have insulted our religion and you should live like us W: and they said if you cannot do it its going to it its going to be disadvantageous for you W: So when there was a crowd there we came forward W: So when I came forward I saw he had blood as well as injuries W: When I saw him thats when I recognized him that I have seen him at the bank TM: Did he say anything to you? W: No he didn’t he was out of his senses at that time TM: He told us that at some stage he became a shia and then he became a sunni again. Do you know that? W: Everyone has their own personal life, what I am trying to tell you is a week after the incident in the bank W: when i asked him what was the problem? W: then he just said casually that there was some problem I had in the bank W: Because you know everyone was in the bank and he couldn’t tell me everything and neither did have  a relationship with him TM: do you know if [the husband] converted into being a shia? W: Yes, because those people were shia people and in the crowd it was also the same people who were beating him up they were shias TM: and did you know that he gave back to being a sunni? W: Yes because, they were saying in the crowd that you converted you didn’t do the right thing and you insulted us Correspondence after hearing After the hearing, the Tribunal sent to the applicants a letter dated 8 January 2014 in which it identified particulars of information the Tribunal considered would, subject to comments the applicants may make, be the reason or part of the reasons for affirming the delegate’s decision.[43] The letter identified seven matters.  The first was what the Tribunal considered to be three inconsistencies between the husband’s and the wife’s written claims, and the evidence they gave before the Tribunal.  The first was that, in their statements, the husband and the wife stated that the wife was pressured into declaring she was a Sunni after a Shi’a man at the religious procession during the tenth day of Mohorram stated that the child was old enough to whip himself. Before the Tribunal, however, the husband said this occurred in 2009, and that it was from that time that the husband and the wife started slowly to withdraw from the Shi’a religion, and that the last gathering they attended was in March 2010.[44] The wife also said to the Tribunal that the incident occurred in 2009. The second inconsistency was that, before the Tribunal, the husband and the wife both said they had converted back to the Sunni religion on 10 October 2010. The husband said that they did that by their solicitor lodging an affidavit at court, sending a letter to the Shi’a community to which the husband and the wife had previously belonged, and placing an advertisement in the newspaper. The Tribunal noted the husband and the wife did not mention these matters in their written applications for Protection visas.[45] Rather, the husband’s and the wife’s statements “convey the impression that well before October 2010 articles were placed in newspapers alleging they had converted back to the Shi’a sect”.[46] The third inconsistency was that, in their statements, the husband and the wife said they intended to return to the Sunni community when the time was right. Before the Tribunal, however, the husband said he had “no plan about that; he said he was just trying to safeguard his future and his family”.[47] The second matter the Tribunal identified as being a reason for the Tribunal affirming the delegate’s decision was the inconsistency between the husband’s and the wife’s evidence about the consequences of converting from the Sunni to the Shi’a sects. The husband and the wife said they were unaware, at the time of their conversion to the Shi’a sect, of sectarian violence in Pakistan in which Sunnis had killed Shi’as, and they did not perceive any risk of suffering harm by converting to that sect. The husband also said he was unaware of the differences between Sunnis and Shi’as, that some Sunnis regarded Shi’as as non-believers, and he did not expect Shi’as to be angry and wanting to harm him and his family when they left that sect. The Tribunal said this was inconsistent with country information which indicated that, for some years, sectarian violence between Sunnis and Shi’as had been taking place in Pakistan and, for that reason, it was difficult to accept the husband’s and the wife’s claims they were unaware of the differences between Sunnis and Shi’as at the time they converted and they did not perceive any risks in converting.[48] The third matter the Tribunal considered as being a reason for the Tribunal affirming the delegate’s decision related to the husband’s and the wife’s claims concerning the procedure by which they converted. The Tribunal said it “may” have difficulty in accepting that the procedures the applicants followed in converting were in fact required and that conversion took place without any in-depth conversations with the husband and the wife about their conversions.[49] The fourth matter the Tribunal considered was that the husband and the wife gave differing accounts before the Tribunal about when they attended the office of the solicitor who prepared the documents in relation to their converting back to the Sunni sect. The husband and wife initially said it was 10 October 2010. The husband then said it was the day before, and the wife said it was three days before. The fifth matter the Tribunal considered would be a reason for affirming the delegate’s decision was what the Tribunal considered to be inconsistencies in the evidence the husband and the wife gave to the Tribunal and to the delegate of the circumstances in which the husband’s and the wife’s conversion back to the Sunni sect was advertised in the newspaper. Before the delegate, the husband said he advertised his conversion because his father advised him that he should properly declare it; and the husband further said that a public declaration was made in a newspaper because he wanted to declare to the Shi’as that if something happened they were responsible. Before the Tribunal, however, the husband said he was not aware the solicitor whose office he attended in October 2010 to sign documents relating to the husband’s and the wife’s conversion was actually going to publicise their conversion including by placing an advertisement in the newspaper.[50] The sixth matter the Tribunal considered would be a reason for affirming the delegate’s decision was that the husband told the Tribunal that when he left Pakistan in February 2011 he left by himself because he did not think his wife would be attacked, and his plan was to return to Pakistan after he completed his studies in Australia.[51] That information was relevant because the Tribunal had difficulty in accepting the husband would honestly think it would be safe to return to Pakistan and for the wife to remain there given the experiences he claimed to have had before he left for Australia.[52] The seventh matter the Tribunal considered would be a reason for affirming the delegate’s decision was the delay in the applicant’s applying for protection. The husband left Pakistan in February 2011, yet he did not apply for protection until August 2012. The Tribunal said this was relevant because the husband had told the Tribunal that one of the reasons he applied for a student visa to come to Australia was because of the harm he feared from Shi’as.[53] The applicants responded to the Tribunal’s letter through their agent by letter dated 17 February 2014.[54] Tribunal’s reasons The Tribunal’s reasons are structured as follows. First, after stating the relevant law, the Tribunal set out the applicants’ claims. In that section, the Tribunal identified country information to the effect that the “incidence of fraudulent documentation in Pakistan is high”.[55] Next, the Tribunal set out its findings. This part of the Tribunal’s reasons largely follows the structure of its letter to the applicants dated 8 January 2014. The Tribunal in part repeats verbatim the matters it stated in its letter that would be the reason or part of the reason for affirming the delegate’s decision, sets out the applicants’ responses to the Tribunal’s letter, and the Tribunal’s findings in relation to the applicants’ responses. The first matter related to the inconsistencies the Tribunal identified in its letter. The Tribunal noted that, in their response of 17 February 2014, the applicants said: the account they gave to the Tribunal was correct;[56] they submitted it was during the ceremony in Moharram held in December 2009 that the wife declared she had returned to the Sunni sect, and that the date given in the statement was incorrect, and the mistaken date of 2010 was inadvertently given to the representative at the time their application for protection was prepared;[57]  the account given to the Tribunal about a solicitor preparing the documents that were used to convert back to the Sunni sect was correct, and that they had omitted to include that information in their written application for Protection visas because they did not think it was important, and they did not want to burden the Department with minor issues;[58] and the husband was stressed and anxious at the hearing, and he meant to say that, at the time he converted to the Shi’a sect, he intended to convert back to the Sunni sect.[59] The Tribunal did not accept these explanations. As to the first explanation, the Tribunal could not believe the husband and the wife would mistakenly put forward the wrong date in their written application.[60] As to the second explanation, the Tribunal found that converting back to the Sunni sect would have been a significant event in their lives, and the Tribunal did not believe the applicants would omit details in relation to that conversion because they thought it was unimportant or minor.[61] As for the third explanation, the Tribunal said it could appreciate the husband would be nervous at the hearing. However, the Tribunal did not believe the husband meant to say to the Tribunal that, at the time he  converted to the Shi’a sect, he intended to convert back to the Sunni sect.[62] The Tribunal concluded this part of its reasons as follows:[63]  Overall, there is significant difference between the evidence given to the Tribunal and the evidence in the written statements of the applicant and his wife about very important matters. According to their written statements, as late as October 2010 they were still participating in Shi’a events; the only public declarations in newspapers about them returning to the Sunni sect were made by Shi’as with the intention of harming them and there was no mention of them attending a solicitor’s office as they told the Tribunal.  Also inconsistent was the evidence about the intentions of the applicant when he became a Shi’a with respect to how long he would remain in that sect and whether he would convert back to being a Sunni. No adequate explanation has been provided for these discrepancies and they reflect poorly on the credibility of the applicant and his wife. The Tribunal then considered the applicants’ responses to the Tribunal’s concerns about the applicant’s claims they were unaware of the differences between Sunnis and Shi’as, and did not perceive any risk in converting. The Tribunal accepted the wife’s response that she had grown up in Dubai, and started to live in Pakistan in 2008, although it was sceptical of the wife’s explanation.[64] The Tribunal, however, did not accept the husband’s explanations.[65]  The husband claimed he did not see sectarian violence had anything to do with his converting; he claimed that, due to restrictions placed on the media in Pakistan, sectarian violence in one part of Pakistan would not be reported in other parts.[66] The husband claimed it was not until after he converted to the Shi’a sect that he found out the two sects had differences about the timing, frequency, and manner of prayer, when fasting is broken, and also about “kalma”.[67] Although the Tribunal was willing to accept it was only after the applicant converted to Shi’a that he found out about differences between the Sunni and Shi’a sects, the Tribunal rejected the husband’s claims he was unaware of violence between Sunnis and Shi’as;[68] and, consequently, the Tribunal disbelieved the husband’s claim that he underestimated or was mistaken in thinking he would not suffer harm from Shi’as for converting back to the Sunni sect.[69]  Next, the Tribunal considered the husband’s response to the Tribunal’s concerns with the husband’s evidence that he was not concerned for the safety of his wife when he left Pakistan, and that he planned to return to Pakistan. In their response, the applicants submitted they took a calculated risk and thought the wife and the child would be safe,[70] and that the risk of harm was reduced because the wife and the child lived with different relatives, and so the Shi’as would lose interest in them.[71] The Tribunal concluded:[72]   In essence, the applicant and his wife claim that the applicant thought that if he left Pakistan his wife and child would not be harmed including if they stayed with different relatives and stayed temporarily in Dubai. The Tribunal does not accept the applicant would honestly have held those views when, since early 2010, he said he and his wife received threats to return to the Shi’a community, in writing, in person and over the telephone and those threats included harm to his wife and child.  In addition, his wife had converted to the Shi’s sect and then converted back to the Sunni sect just as he had done. In all of these claimed circumstances, the Tribunal does not accept that the applicant would think that only he was of interest to the Shia’s. Finally, the Tribunal considered the applicants’ explanation for their delay in applying for protection. At the hearing, the husband said he first made enquiries about obtaining protection in Australia after the wife and the child arrived in January 2012. After the wife arrived, however, the husband and the wife were trying to work out what to do. The husband thought he would apply for a visa to study in Australia and then go to Kuwait because he has a brother-in-law there. The husband contacted the brother-in-law who told him he could not apply for protection, but should do so in Australia.[73] In their response to the Tribunal’s letter of 8 January 2014, the applicants submitted, among other things, they did not think the difficulties with the Shi’as would last so long because the husband thought that if he left Pakistan to study in Australia that would resolve the problem.[74] The Tribunal did not accept these explanations:[75]  Overall, the applicant’s inaction to make inquiries once he came to Australia and, in particular, from May 2011 when his wife was attacked, is inconsistent with a person genuinely in fear of harm. His inaction, in his claimed circumstances, is inconceivable. The Tribunal then made findings on the husband’s and the wife’s credibility. The applicant found the husband was not a witness of truth, and the account of events on which his protection claims were based was false.[76] The Tribunal also found that, although the wife purported to corroborate the husband’s account of the events on which their protection claims were based, the Tribunal was of the view that, for the reasons it relied for not accepting the husband’s account, the Tribunal considered the wife’s account also to be false.[77] The Tribunal accepted the husband was under investigation by the bank, but was eventually exonerated, but not because the husband had converted to the Shi’a sect.[78]  Critical to the applicants’ challenge to the Tribunal’s decision is the following finding:[79]  The Tribunal finds that there is no credible evidence that the applicant, his wife and child were ever harmed by anyone in Pakistan and there is no credible evidence that anyone or any group wishes to harm them. There is no credible evidence as to why they left Pakistan and why they do not want to return there. The Tribunal did refer to the statutory declaration provided by Mr S, and to the evidence he gave at the hearing.[80] After setting out the effect of Mr S’s evidence, the Tribunal said:[81]  The Tribunal has carefully considered the evidence of Mr [S] but the fact that he has claimed to have witnessed the applicant being attacked by Shi’as in October 2010 does not persuade the Tribunal that the account of events advanced by the applicants on which their protection claims are based is true.  The concerns about the credibility discussed above in this decision, in the Tribunal’s view, significantly discredit them as witnesses.  Those concerns colour the credibility of the entire account and not just one incident in October 2010.  The evidence of this particular witness does not outweigh or alleviate those credibility concerns.   Accordingly, the Tribunal accepts that this witness was a customer at the bank where the applicant worked and knew him in that context.  The Tribunal finds his evidence about witnessing the attack on the applicant in October 2010 and this being related to the applicant converting from the Shi’a sect to the Sunni sect is false. The Tribunal found that the documents on which the applicants relied “considered separately or cumulatively” did not “alleviate to overcome the concerns the Tribunal holds about the applicants’ credibility”,[82] and the Tribunal also was of the view it had to consider available country information about the prevalence of false documents in Pakistan.[83] For those reasons:[84] [T]he Tribunal finds that it cannot and does not attribute evidentiary weight to these documents which have been produced to the department and Tribunal to support the protection claims of the applicants. The Tribunal remains of the view that those claims are false. Should leave be granted to reopen? The Minister submits that the applicants have not complied with the orders I made on 29 October 2014 that the applicants file an application in a case by 28 January 2015. The applicants only filed written submissions attaching a draft proposed amended application. That is a formal objection. In their written submissions, the applicants specifically sought leave to reopen their case. In other words, the applicants have in substance complied with the orders I made. I propose to proceed on the basis that, by filing their written submissions and draft amended application by 28 January 2015, they have complied with the orders I made on 29 October 2014. The only other ground on which the Minister opposes the application for leave to reopen and, hence, leave to amend the application, is that the proposed grounds of review do not have reasonable prospects of success. For the reasons that will be apparent, the proposed grounds do have reasonable prospects of success. In my opinion, it is in the interests of the administration of justice that I grant the applicants leave to reopen their case.  I propose to order, therefore, that the applicants have leave to reopen their case to the extent necessary to apply to amend their application and to make submissions in support of the grounds contained in the proposed amended application. I will also grant the applicants leave to file an amended application in the form of the draft attached to the applicants’ written submissions that were filed on 28 January 2015. Ground 1 – unreasonable and irrational rejection of the evidence of Mr S The first ground of the amended application is directed to the Tribunal’s finding that there was no credible evidence the husband, the wife, and the child were ever harmed by anyone in Pakistan. The applicants submit the finding is irrational, or unreasonable, or both; and the finding is irrational, or unreasonable because there was credible evidence before the Tribunal that, if accepted, showed the husband had been attacked in October 2010, just as the husband had claimed. The applicants submit the Tribunal’s reasoning was circular. On the one hand, the Tribunal found there was no credible evidence the applicants had been harmed; yet, on the other hand, it found Mr S’s evidence was not credible for reasons that included the Tribunal’s finding that there was no credible evidence to support the applicants’ claims of harm.[85]  The applicants’ submission is premised on the proposition that the evidence of Mr S was credible. Whether or not Mr S’s evidence was credible, however, is not a question for this Court to determine; it was a matter for the Tribunal to determine. The Court does, of course, have jurisdiction to review a decision made by the Tribunal based on the Tribunal’s credibility findings; but that jurisdiction is limited to intervening where the Tribunal’s credibility findings are irrational, or unreasonable, or where the Tribunal arrived at the credibility findings in some other manner that discloses jurisdictional error. The relevant question is whether it was reasonably open to the Tribunal to reject Mr S’s evidence for the reasons it gave.  The first step in answering that question is to properly characterise the Tribunal’s reasoning. The applicants are correct in submitting that the Tribunal first considered and made adverse findings about the husband’s and the wife’s credibility before the Tribunal considered whether to give credit to Mr S’s evidence, having regard to those adverse findings. The Tribunal committed no jurisdictional error, however, in taking that approach.  It is true it has been held that the Tribunal may make a jurisdictional error if, having made adverse credibility findings against an applicant, the Tribunal decides not to consider evidence that corroborates the applicant’s claims; and the Tribunal will make a jurisdictional error in those circumstances unless the applicant’s claims have been so comprehensively discredited by findings of dishonesty or untruthfulness that the corroborative evidence is negated.[86] In other words, it is not:[87]  ...open to the Tribunal to state that it is unnecessary for it to consider material corroborative of an applicant’s claims merely because it considers it unlikely that the events described by an applicant occurred. In such a circumstance the Tribunal would be bound to have regard to the corroborative material before attempting to reach a conclusion on the applicant’s credibility. Failure to do so would provide a determination not carried out according to law and the decision would be affected by jurisdictional error. On the other hand, it is open to the Tribunal to reject corroborative evidence because the Tribunal made adverse credibility findings against an applicant, or an applicant’s claims, provided the Tribunal considered the corroborative evidence. That is what the Full Court of the Federal Court held in Minister for Immigration and Citizenship v SZNSP.[88] In that case the Tribunal found the applicant had fabricated her claim of fear of persecution and, because of the adverse credibility findings it made of the applicant, the Tribunal decided not to give any weight to a witness statement that apparently corroborated the applicant’s claims. The words the Tribunal used were: “Given the adverse credibility finding, the Tribunal does not give weight to the document”.[89] The Full Federal Court said:[90]  Thus, consistently with Applicant S20/2002 198 ALR 59 it was open to the RRT to assess the credit of the first respondent and then, in the light of that assessment, consider what weight should be given to the witness statement. This was the process followed by the RRT which it described in the sentence “Given the adverse credibility finding, the Tribunal does not give weight to the document”. Although expressed in the most cryptic terms, this statement shows that the RRT made an assessment of the value of the witness statement and then considered its effect in the light of the view it had formed to that point about the credibility of the first respondent. What the Full Federal Court said about the Tribunal’s not accepting the witness statement in SZNSP applies with greater force to the Tribunal’s approach in not accepting Mr S’s evidence; the Tribunal in the case before me exhibited more detailed reasoning for not accepting Mr S’s evidence than did the Tribunal in SZNSP. The Tribunal in the case before me held it had concerns about the husband’s and the wife’s credibility, not only in relation to one element of their claims for protection, namely, the husband’s claimed attack in October 2010, but in relation to most other elements. These included the circumstances in which the husband and the wife claimed they had converted back to the Sunni sect which, the Tribunal found, contained important inconsistencies between their written claims, and the evidence they gave to the Tribunal. The Tribunal was unpersuaded that the apparent corroboration of one element of the applicants’ claims was sufficient to remove the Tribunal’s reasons for doubting other elements of their accounts and, therefore, for doubting their entire case for protection. It was reasonably open to the Tribunal to reason in that way. The logic of the Tribunal’s approach can be described in greater detail. The Tribunal had before it apparently direct evidence given by the husband and the wife of events which, if accepted, would prove they suffered the harm and the threat of harm from Shi’as they claimed to have suffered; and there was additional apparently direct evidence from Mr S which, if accepted, would corroborate the husband’s evidence of one of those events. On the other hand, there were matters (adverse matters) on the basis of which it was reasonably open to the Tribunal not to accept, not only the evidence of the husband and the wife, but also the evidence of Mr S. The adverse matters consisted of the inconsistencies the Tribunal identified between the evidence the husband and the wife gave before the Tribunal and the accounts they gave in their written application for Protection visas, their delay in applying for Protection visas, and the explanations the husband and the wife gave for the inconsistencies and for their delay in applying for Protection visas. The adverse matters largely related to the testimony the husband and the wife gave of events other than the claimed attack on the husband in October 2010, being the event that was apparently corroborated by the evidence of Mr S. That is, the adverse matters related to events the husband and the wife testified had occurred which could not have been corroborated by the evidence of Mr S, assuming his evidence were accepted. The Tribunal, as it was reasonably open for it to do, found that the adverse matters, relating as they did to the testimony of the husband and the wife of events other than the claimed attack of 10 October 2010, prevented the Tribunal from being satisfied that those events had occurred. Having so concluded, the Tribunal considered whether to assign credibility to Mr S’s evidence. It found it could assign no credibility to Mr S’s evidence, given that it did not accept the husband and the wife’s evidence that events that were not apparently corroborated by Mr S’s evidence did occur. In those circumstances, it was reasonably open to the Tribunal not to assign credibility to the evidence of Mr S.  For these reasons, ground 1 of the amended application fails. Ground 2 – failure to review The second ground of the amended application is that the Tribunal failed to discharge its core function to review the decision because it did not have proper regard to the evidence of Mr S. The applicants submit the Tribunal failed to have proper regard to the evidence of Mr S because it made an arbitrary finding that his evidence was false “merely because it had credibility concerns about the” husband and the wife.[91] I do not accept this submission. The Tribunal did consider and did have proper regard to the evidence of Mr S. When dealing with the evidence of Mr S, the Tribunal said that its concerns with the credibility of the husband and the wife coloured the credibility of the husband’s and the wife’s entire account, and not just the account of one incident, being the incident the evidence of Mr S purported to corroborate. The Tribunal said that the apparently corroborative evidence of Mr S did not alleviate the Tribunal’s concerns.[92] That indicates that the Tribunal considered whether the existence of apparently corroborative evidence of one of a number of events on which the husband and the wife relied, namely, the attack on the husband on 10 October 2010, was sufficient to cause the Tribunal to overcome the concerns the Tribunal had with the credibility of the husband’s and the wife’s accounts, not only of the claimed attack but of all other critical events on which the husband and the wife relied. That manifests a due consideration by the Tribunal of the apparently corroborative evidence of Mr S. It was reasonably open to the Tribunal to conclude, as it did, that Mr S’s evidence was insufficient to cause the Tribunal to overcome its concerns.  Ground 2 of the amended application, therefore, also fails. Ground 3 – failure to alert applicants that evidence of Mr S may be found to be false The third ground is that the Tribunal failed to comply with s.425 of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) (Act) because it failed to put to Mr S that his evidence was false, and it failed to put to the husband that the Tribunal considered Mr S’s evidence to be false. The applicants rely on the decision of Judge Driver in Kaur & Anor v Minister for Immigration & Anor.[93]  In Kaur, the Migration Review Tribunal (MRT) affirmed a decision of a delegate of the Minister not to grant to Ms Kaur a Skilled Residence (Class VB) visa. The delegate did not grant the visa because the delegate was not satisfied Ms Kaur had not provided a bogus document, and it was not satisfied that the requirement that Ms Kaur not have provided a bogus document should be waived. Before the MRT, Ms Kaur submitted that the requirement should be waived because there were compelling circumstances that affected the interests of Australia. The asserted compelling circumstances related to Ms Kaur’s sister. As described by Judge Driver, the asserted circumstances were “Ms Kaur’s sister, and her sister’s husband work, in order to make ends meet; they were able to work because Ms Kaur looked after her sister’s child; Ms Kaur’s sister and her family would suffer significant hardship if the visa were not granted, because no one would be able to look after the child if Ms Kaur had to depart Australia (if the Class VB visa was not granted)”. [94]  Ms Kaur’s sister, Ms Begum, gave evidence before the MRT, but the MRT did not accept her evidence. Judge Driver held the MRT did not, as it was required to do by s.360 of the Act, give Ms Kaur the opportunity to give evidence and present arguments relating to the issues arising in relation to the decision under review. His Honour so held because the review before the MRT “turned on the probative value of Ms Begum’s” evidence, and the MRT “needed to ensure that Ms Kaur understood that the essential and significant issue upon which the review would turn was the probative value of Ms Begum’s evidence”.[95] The applicants submit that his Honour’s reasoning in Kaur applies to their circumstances. They submit that s.360 of the Act is in the same terms as s.425; as the MRT failed to do in Kaur, so the Tribunal in the application before me failed to put to Mr S that it considered his evidence to be false, and it failed to explain the significance of Mr S’s evidence and the probative value of that evidence to the applicants.[96] The facts in Kaur are, however, distinguishable. In Kaur, the assertions of the witness in question that were made before the Tribunal “did not figure in the delegate’s decision”.[97] That is not the case in the application before me. The applicants claimed in their written application that the husband was attacked in October 2010, and this assertion, together with the wife’s assertions of having been beaten, figured in the delegate’s decision. The delegate said she had “serious doubts about the genuineness of these claims”.[98] In any event, Kaur would be plainly wrong if it were read as authority for the proposition that the Tribunal is obliged give to the applicant notice of the evidence that is before it which the Tribunal might not accept or might consider to be false, and must also give notice of the significance and probative value of that evidence. That would be so for two reasons. First, such obligation would exceed the obligation imposed on the Tribunal by s.424A of the Act to notify the applicant of particulars of “information” on which the Tribunal might act to affirm the decision under review. The “information” to which s.424A applies “does not encompass the tribunal’s subjective appraisals, thought processes or determinations”; nor “does it extend to identified gaps, defects or lack of detail or specificity in evidence or to conclusions arrived at by the tribunal in weighing up the evidence by reference to those gaps”.[99] The meaning of “information” is “related to the existence of evidentiary material or documentation, not the existence of doubts, inconsistencies or the absence of evidence”.[100] To read Kaur as requiring the Tribunal to notify an applicant that it may consider evidence given to it as false would, contrary to what s.424A of the Act has been held to require, require the Tribunal to at least give the applicant notice of its “subjective appraisals, thought processes or determinations”. Second, if Kaur were read as obliging the Tribunal to give to an applicant notice of the evidence that is before it which the Tribunal might not accept, and must also give notice of the significance and probative value of that evidence, such obligation would exceed the obligations the Tribunal has under s.425 of the Act to give notice. Those obligations were identified by the High Court in SZBEL v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs.[101] In SZSRB v Minister for Immigration & Anor I summarised the principles the High Court articulated in SZBEL as follows:[102] At common law, a duty to accord procedural fairness consists in providing to the person likely to be affected by the decision with an opportunity to put information and submissions to the decision-maker in support of the outcome the persons seeks.[103] The duty extends to the decision-maker identifying to the person likely to be affected “any issue critical to the decision which is not apparent from its nature or the terms under which it is made”, and advising the person to be affected “of any adverse conclusion which has been arrived at which would not obviously be open on the known material”.[104] Section 425 of the Act defines the nature of the opportunity to be heard that is to be given to an applicant for review by the Tribunal.[105] It requires the Tribunal to invite the applicant to “give evidence and present arguments relating to the issues arising in relation to the decision under review”. Those issues will not be sufficiently identified in every case by describing them simply as whether the applicant is entitled to a protection visa.[106] The issues that arise in relation to the decision are to be identified by the Tribunal. If “the Tribunal takes no step to identify some issue other than those that the delegate considered dispositive, and does not tell the applicant what that other issue is, the applicant is entitled to assume that the issues the delegate considered dispositive are ‘the issues arising in relation to the decision under review’”.[107] There may be cases where the Tribunal’s statements or questions during a hearing sufficiently indicate to an applicant that everything he or she says in support of the application is in issue:  That indication may be given in many ways. It is not necessary (and often would be inappropriate) for the Tribunal to put to an applicant, in so many words, that he or she is lying, that he or she may not be accepted as a witness of truth, or that he or she may be thought to be embellishing the account that is given of certain events . . . But where . . . there are specific aspects of an applicant’s account, that the Tribunal considers may be important to the decision and may be open to doubt, the Tribunal must at least ask the applicant to expand upon those aspects of the account and ask the applicant to explain why the account should be accepted.[108] Further, the High Court said:[109] If the issues on the review of the delegate’s decision by the Tribunal are identified no more particularly than by the question “is the applicant entitled to a protection visa?” rejection of some or all aspects of his account of the past events said to found his fears of persecution would self-evidently be a conclusion open to the Tribunal. The conclusion would be open because every aspect of the applicant’s claim would be in issue in the Tribunal’s review of the delegate’s decision, but if the issues are to be identified more particularly, other questions arise. Returning to the circumstances of the case before me, the delegate did not accept the husband’s claim that he was attacked in October 2010. That meant the applicants were on notice that whether or not the husband was attacked as he claimed would be one of the issues that would be before the Tribunal. In those circumstances, rejection of this aspect of the applicant’s claims was self-evidently a conclusion open to the Tribunal. That necessarily implies that the rejection of any apparently corroborative evidence was also a conclusion open to the Tribunal without the Tribunal being obliged to give any further notice to the applicant. The Tribunal, therefore, was under no obligation to give to the applicants notice of any of the matters of which the applicants submit the Tribunal should have given to them. Ground 3 of the amended application, therefore, also fails. Conclusion and disposition The applicants have not succeeded on any of the three grounds stated in the amended application. I propose, therefore, to dismiss the application. I will also order that the Administrative Appeals Tribunal be substituted as the second respondent. I will hear the parties on costs.I certify that the preceding sixty-two (62) paragraphs are a true copy of the reasons for judgment of Judge ManousaridisAssociate:  Date: 18 December 2015 [1] SZUCJ & Ors v Minister for Immigration & Anor [2014] FCCA 2624[2] CB33-44[3] CB33; CB381-384[4] CB381[5] CB385[6] CB385[7] CB33[8] CB389[9] CB388[10] CB34[11] CB463[12] CB464-465[13] CB34[14] CB34[15] CB34-35[16] CB35[17] CB164[18] CB164[19] CB167[20] CB35[21] CB35[22] CB36[23] CB549, [15][24] CB36[25] CB170-171[26] CB174[27] CB36[28] CB36; CB176[29] CB36[30] CB36[31] CB37[32] CB37[33] CB37; CB179[34] CB37[35] CB37; CB183[36] CB37; CB186[37] CB38[38] CB302[39] CB563, [118][40] CB563, [119]-[120][41] CB386[42] Affidavit of the husband, 28.01.2015, annexure “A”[43] CB325[44] CB326[45] CB326[46] CB326[47] CB327[48] CB327[49] CB328[50] CB329[51] CB329[52] CB330[53] CB330[54] CB496[55] CB551, [23][56] CB554, [47][57] CB554, [48][58] CB555, [51][59] CB555, [54][60] CB555, [50][61] CB555, [52][62] CB555, [55][63] CB555-556, [56]-[57][64] CB557, [67][65] CB557, [67][66] CB557, [68][67] CB557, [69][68] CB558, [75][69] CB558, [76][70] CB559, [82][71] CB559, [83][72] CB559, [86], [87][73] CB560, [92][74] CB560, [97].

However, when he arrived in Australia and studied at a college he did not realize that he could apply for a Protection Visa but if he knew that his problem with the Shia is not going to go away and that he can apply for a Protection Visa in Australia he would have done so a long time ago.” (CB504-505)[75] CB561, [105][76] CB561, [106][77] CB562, [108][78] CB562, [111][79] CB562, [112][80] CB563, [118]-[120][81] CB563, [121]-[123][82] CB566, [135][83] CB566, [135][84] CB566, [136][85] Applicants’ Outline Of Submissions, [10][86] WAIJ v Minister for Immigration & Multicultural & Indigenous Affairs  [2004] FCAFC 74; (2004) 80 ALD 568 at  [27] (Lee and Moore JJ)[87] WAIJ v Minister for Immigration & Multicultural & Indigenous Affairs  [2004] FCAFC 74; (2004) 80 ALD 568  at  [27] (Lee and Moore JJ)[88] [2010] FCAFC 50;  (2010) 184 FCR 485 (North, Lander and Katzmann JJ)[89] [2010] FCAFC 50;  (2010) 184 FCR 485 at  [13][90] [2010] FCAFC 50;  (2010) 184 FCR 485 at  [33] (North and Lander JJ; Katzmann J agreeing at [42])[91] Applicants’ Outline Of  Submissions, [12][92] CB563, [122][93] [2013] FCCA 1162[94] [2013] FCCA 1162 at  [14][95] [2013] FCCA 1162 at  [67][96] Applicants’ Outline Of Submissions, [17][97] [2013] FCCA 1162 at  [64][98] CB229[99] VAF v Minister for Immigration & Multicultural & Indigenous Affairs  [2004] FCAFC 123;  (2004) 206 ALR 471 at  [477] (Finn and Stone JJ) quoted with approval by the High Court in SZBYR v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship  [2007] HCA 26;  (2007) 235 ALR 609 at 616 ([18]).[100] SZBYR v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship  [2007] HCA 26;  (2007) 235 ALR 609 at 616 ([18])[101] [2006] HCA 63;  (2006) 228 CLR 152[102] [2013] FCCA 1382 at  [46] [103] SZBEL v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] HCA 63;  (2006) 228 CLR 152 at  [29].

       " 'SZURP & Ors v Minister for Immigration & Anor [2015] FCCA 3477 (1 December 2015)': \" (Ex Tempore; Revised from Transcript)  This is an application made pursuant to s.476 of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) (“the Act”) on 10 July 2014, seeking review of the decision of the then Refugee Review Tribunal, now known as the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (“the Tribunal”), made on 16 June 2014 which affirmed the decision of the Minister’s delegate to refuse protection visas to the applicants. Background  In evidence before the Court is a bundle of relevant documents filed by the Minister (“the Court Book” – “CB”). The following background can be ascertained from those documents. The applicants are citizens of the People’s Republic of China (“China”). The first applicant (“the applicant”) and second applicant are in a de facto relationship and have a child (“the third applicant”) (CB 2).  The applicant arrived in Australia on 21 February 2008 on a student visa (Class TU Subclass 571) (CB 3). The second applicant arrived in Australia in May 2008 also on a student visa ([28] at CB 182). The applicants applied for protection visas on 15 February 2013 (CB 1 to CB 52). The second and third applicants applied as members of the applicant’s family group (CB 16 to CB 29). They were assisted in their application by a registered migration agent (item 16 at CB 38 and CB 40 to CB 42). The applicant’s claims to protection can be summarised as follows. She was sent to live with her aunt shortly after she was born as she was her parent’s second child and they feared “consequences” from the local authorities, as they were unable to pay the child’s “registration money” (CB 7). Her parents paid a bribe and the applicant was finally registered in 1997, and she returned home (CB 8).  The applicant continued to visit her aunt. In the “school holidays” in June 2006 they both joined an underground Christian church where she was “moved” by the Holy Spirit and was baptised on 20 August 2006 (CB 8). The applicant attended three church activities a week (CB 9).  On 25 December 2007 the police arrested her at school for her participation in an “illegal religious organisation”. The applicant was detained in “inhumane conditions” (CB 9 to CB 10).  She was forced into signing a confession where she named other members of her church. Her father paid the police a bribe and she was released on 31 December 2007. Her father had been making arrangements for her to study in Australia, including paying a bribe to ensure she was able to leave the country, and she departed on 20 February 2008.  The applicant learnt that her aunt, and others that she named, were imprisoned in China for 10 years (CB 10). The applicant claimed that due to her guilty feelings arising from this, she did not apply for protection in Australia earlier (CB 10). The applicant claimed that she had attended the Christian church in Australia and continued to pray. The applicant claimed that if she were to return to China as a Christian she would be subject to persecution by the Chinese authorities (CB 10).  The applicant commenced a relationship with the second applicant in May 2011. Their daughter was born on 13 June 2012. The third applicant was born out of wedlock. The applicant claimed they would have to pay a fine to register the child in China, which she claimed they will have difficulty in doing. She claimed that their daughter will be regarded as a “black child” and her human rights will be “seriously” threatened (CB 10).  A delegate of the Minister refused the grant of a protection visa on 23 August 2013 (CB 79 to CB 105). It is clear from the decision record that the delegate had concerns about the applicant’s delay in applying for protection, the lack of her relevant knowledge about Christianity, and the lack of documentary support for her claims, that is, a letter from any church.  The delegate found that the applicant could pay any registration fee in China in relation to having a child out of wedlock.   The applicants applied for review to the Tribunal on 20 September 2013 (CB 107 to CB 112). The Tribunal affirmed the decision of the Minister’s delegate on 16 June 2014 (CB 178 to CB 195). The applicants’ claims, as they were before the Tribunal, are set out in the Tribunal’s decision record. This included the Tribunal’s account of what was said at the hearing ([5] CB 179 to [53] at CB 186).  At the Tribunal hearing, the applicant stated that she was 30 weeks pregnant and that if they were to return to China, they would be unable to pay the social compensation fee for the second child ([53] at CB 186). The Tribunal noted that it was not until after the applicant, and the second applicant, were “found out” by “immigration” that they lodged their protection visa application ([60] at CB 190). The Tribunal had serious concerns regarding the applicant’s migration history, her lengthy stay in Australia, the fact that the applicant and second applicant became “unlawful” in Australia for a protracted period, and the claim that they would both be at risk if they return to China ([61] at CB 190).  Further, the Tribunal stated that it ([62] at CB 190):  “... considered the applicant’s delay in lodging her protection visa application, and finds that the applicant's failure to lodge a protection visa application, when viewed in the context of her migration history, that of her partner, her becoming unlawful in Australia, is inconsistent with a subjective fear of persecution for reasons of religion. The applicant remained unlawfully in Australia for some two years despite claiming to have become a Christian.  Further the adult applicants had a child outside wedlock, her partner had also been unlawful for a considerable period of time and both risked return to the PRC during their unlawful stays in Australia both occurring prior to the lodgement of the application forming the subject matter of this review.  The Tribunal concludes that the applicant does not have a subjective fear of persecution for reasons of religion or family planning regulations in respect of the applicant child. The Tribunal finds that these factors seriously undermine the applicant’s credibility in relation to her claimed fear of persecution in the PRC.”  The Tribunal had serious concerns as to the applicant’s migration history and her claimed conversion to Christianity, especially given her failure to mention that she feared returning to China for reasons of “religion or family planning regulations when ‘found out’ by compliance” ([63] at CB 190).  The Tribunal found that the applicant displayed some knowledge of Christianity, noting that she had been found “wanting” by the delegate in this regard ([64] – [65] at CB 190). The Tribunal found that when the applicant was asked questions regarding the importance of Christianity to her life, her manner, when presenting evidence, “changed markedly”, and she became “hesitant” and “paused at length”. The Tribunal found that she was able to recite memorised information from the Bible, but that her answers regarding her religious convictions and motivation was superficial, “unpersuasive, hesitant, lacked spontaneity or any reflection of deep religious convictions”.  Further, that the applicant’s knowledge of, and her account of how she became a follower of Christianity was not a “reliable indicator” of her genuine Christian belief ([66] at CB 191).  The Tribunal further found that ([67] at CB 191):  “...given her lack of knowledge at interview, her demeanour whilst giving evidence, her hesitation in giving responses, and delivery of evidence which was presented as though memorised and recited, that her evidence was memorised for the purpose of strengthening her claim. It finds her evidence in relation to Christianity not to be credible.” The Tribunal found that the applicant was not a “genuine practicing Christian”, did not attend a family church in China, or that any of her family members were, or are, Christians, or that she implicated anyone with a statement that she made at the time ([69] – [72] at CB 191). Further, the Tribunal did not accept that the applicant’s attendance at church in Australia was indicative of the fact that she is a genuine practicing Christian, given its credibility concerns ([73] at CB 191). The Tribunal noted the applicant’s ability to depart China legally, without “hindrance”, despite her claims to have been detained there and to have attended church gatherings ([74] at CB 191 to CB 192). Further, the Tribunal was not satisfied that ([79] at CB 192):  “...the applicant will be targeted or mistreated by the authorities in China for being a genuine practicing Christian, and is not of any interest to the authorities in the PRC given her ability to depart legally. Given that this is the central element of her claim, the Tribunal finds that there is insufficient credible evidence upon which to make a finding that the applicant is a Convention refugee for reasons of religion.” The Tribunal noted that the applicants would be returning to China as a couple who are now parents with one child and expecting another, were students in Australia, and would be eligible for an exemption from the payment of social compensation fees. The Tribunal found that, given their own qualifications and experience, family income, the ability to pay the fee through instalments, and when considered in all the circumstances, the applicants would be in a position to pay the social compensation fee. The Tribunal found that, given the absence of evidence of any forced sterilisation of termination of pregnancies in the Fujian province, there was no real chance that the applicant or the unborn child would face persecution based on this claim ([81] at CB 192 to CB 193). Having regard to country information before it, the Tribunal held that the applicants would not be required to pay bribes in relation to the family planning regulations. The applicants would not be “singled out”, and “differentially treated” by the government of China as the “enforcement of a generally applicable law”, such as the family planning laws in China, do not ordinarily constitute persecution for the purposes of the Refugee’s Convention. The Tribunal referred to Brennan CJ in Applicant A v Minister for Immigration & Ethnic Affairs [1997] HCA 4; (1997) 190 CLR 225 in coming to this finding ([82] – [84] at CB 193).  The Tribunal also had regard to country information before it and evidence given by the applicants in relation to their ability to pay the social compensation fee ([85] at CB 193 to [87] at CB 194). The Tribunal found that ([86] at CB 194):  “...given the applicants’ skills and work experience, there would be no serious impediments to them in securing employment in the PRC and in being able to pay the social compensation fees given their skills, education, and demonstrated ability to adapt to a new country and to support themselves.” The Tribunal found that there was no real chance that the applicants would face persecution in China for a Refugees’ Convention reason ([90] at CB 194). The Tribunal further found that there were not substantial grounds for believing that there was a real risk that the applicants would suffer significant harm if they returned to China ([91] – [92] at CB 194 to CB 195).  Application before the Court  The grounds of the application before the Court are in the following terms:  “1. Tribunal member think I am in order to apply for protection visa to go to church. He can’t doubt me without according.  2. Tribunal member negative right I am a genuine practicing Christian, I think he didn’t trust me from beginning to end, just want to reject my application.” The grounds were not particularised. Before the Court  The second applicant appeared at a first Court date on 21 August 2014 and was assisted by an interpreter in the Mandarin language. The second applicant appeared for the first and third applicant. At this time, orders were made appointing the second applicant as the litigation guardian of the third applicant. The applicants were provided with the opportunity to file any amended application and any evidence by way of affidavit. Nothing further has been filed by the applicants. Before the Court today, the applicant appeared in person and was assisted by an interpreter in the Mandarin language. She advised that the second and third applicants were outside the Court and that she would speak on their behalf.   Before the Court the applicant submitted that the Tribunal had said that she had not given a “good answer” at the departmental interview in relation to her knowledge about Christianity. However, that the Tribunal had said at the hearing before it that she had given “reasonable” answers.  However, in spite of that observation, the Tribunal said that she only learnt this knowledge in the recent past so that she could strengthen her claims to protection in Australia.  The applicant complained that she was only asked one question about her Christian beliefs at the interview with the delegate.   Consideration  I understood the complaint to be that it was not fair, or open, to the Tribunal to come to the conclusion that it did, in light of the comparison on which it relied, which was based on a circumstance where she was only asked one question about her Christian beliefs by the delegate. There are a number of answers to the applicant’s complaint.  The first is that despite opportunity, the applicants have not put before the Court any evidence as to what they say may have occurred at the interview with the delegate.  The delegate’s decision is in evidence before the Court (CB 73 to CB 105).  With reference, in particular, to the account of the interview in the delegate’s decision record (from CB 92 to CB 95), it reveals that there were a number of points about religion and religious practice which were discussed at the interview. This is contrary to, and does not support, the applicant’s claim that she was only asked one question. I also note that the complaint made about the delegate’s interview in this regard was also put to the Tribunal. The Tribunal records the applicant’s answer at [44] (at CB 185) of its decision record.  In any event, the short answer to the applicant’s complaint is that the Tribunal’s assessment of her knowledge of Christianity, and her religious practice, did not simply derive from what may, or may not have, occurred at the interview with the delegate.   It is clear from the Tribunal’s account of the hearing that the applicant was given the opportunity to explain her religious beliefs. In part, the Tribunal’s concerns about her claimed religious belief arose from a number of factors, including her incapacity to explain her religious experience and knowledge at the hearing with the Tribunal, and her delay in applying for protection. The delay was seen by the Tribunal as being inconsistent with a genuine fear of persecution, or harm, if the applicant were to return to China.  The applicant says the Tribunal’s decision in this regard was not fair.  On the material before the Court, and it must be said there is no evidence by the applicants to challenge that material, the Tribunal’s conclusion, was reasonably open to it on the material that was before it.  No jurisdictional error is revealed in this regard. Ground one, with respect to the applicants, lacks coherence.  As the Minister submits at best, it would appear that, again, this ground seeks to take issue with the Tribunal’s finding that the applicant only attended church in Australia in order to bolster her claims to protection.   As I have already stated, in the absence of any evidence about what occurred at the hearing, the Tribunal’s account of what occurred reveals that the Tribunal squarely raised the question of her church activities in Australia with the applicant at the hearing, and that she was given the opportunity to respond. I note [51] of the Tribunal’s decision record, in this regard (at CB 185):  “The applicant was asked whether her church activities in Australia were motivated by her protection claim and responded that had she intended to apply for protection as a means to remain in Australia she would have done so long ago and not waited until she was found by compliance.” I agree with the Minister’s submissions that the applicants were on notice that the question of the genuineness and motivation for the applicant’s church activities was raised at the hearing, and the Tribunal complied with its procedural fairness obligations as those are understood to arise from s.425 of the Act.  The Tribunal, consistent with High Court authority in SZBEL v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs & Anor [2006] HCA 63;  (2006) 228 CLR 152, raised the issues which were dispositive of the review.  However, it is also of note that the applicants could have been left in no doubt, following the delegate’s decision record, that the question of claimed religious beliefs and the delay in applying for protection in Australia were live issues as a result of that decision.  I note the Minister’s comprehensive submissions today regarding various points in the Tribunal’s account of what occurred at the hearing, where matters of religious practice and conduct were raised with the applicant (see [30] at CB 182 to [44] at CB 185).  The Tribunal’s relevant findings on this issue were reasonably open to it on what was before it. It gave cogent and intelligible reasons for these findings.  No jurisdictional error is revealed in ground one and it is not made out. Ground two can only be understood as an attempt to assert that the Tribunal member was biased. As the Minister again correctly submits, such an allegation is serious for the reason that, unlike many other assertions of legal error, it is an attack on the very integrity of the decision-maker. It is for this reason that such allegations need to be distinctly made and clearly proven (Minister for Immigration & Multicultural Affairs v Jia Legeng  [2001] HCA 17 (2001) 205 CLR 507 at  [69] and [127], SBBS v Minister for Immigration & Multicultural & Indigenous Affairs [2002] FCAFC 361; (2002) 194 ALR 749, VFAB v Minister for Immigration & Multicultural & Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCA 872;  (2003) 131 FCR 102 and Re Refugee Review Tribunal; Ex parte H [2001] HCA 28;  (2001) 179 ALR 425).  In the current circumstances, it cannot be said that a claim of bias has been clearly made or properly pleaded.  No particulars are provided. A general assertion that the applicant did not “think” she was trusted from the beginning is not sufficient to explain the claimed bias.  On the evidence before the Court, it would appear that this is no more than a disagreement with the Tribunal’s adverse findings relating to the applicant’s claims.  In any event, no bias is evident in the material that is before the Court. Ground two also fails to reveal jurisdictional error and is not made out. In submissions before the Court today the Minister drew the Court’s attention to the manner in which the Tribunal explored the applicant’s religious beliefs and practice.  I agree with, and accept, the Minister’s submission that the Tribunal did not set itself up as the arbiter of religious doctrine, as this concept is explained in relevant authorities (Minister for Immigration and Citizenship v SZLSP  [2010] FCAFC 108, in particular the judgment of Kenny J, and Minister for Immigration and Citizenship v SZOCT [2010] FCAFC 159;  (2010) 189 FCR 577). I accept the Minister’s submission, on the evidence presented, that the Tribunal’s questions to the applicant in this regard, as revealed in its account of the hearing, which is not challenged before the Court by any other evidence, were open-ended questions inviting the applicant to explain her beliefs and practice rather than expecting some predetermined answer from her. The grounds of the application do not reveal jurisdictional error.  Nothing that the applicants have put before the Court today reveals jurisdictional error in the Tribunal’s decision record.  It is clear that the applicants are aggrieved by the Tribunal’s decision. As I explained to the applicant today, the question for the Court is not whether the Tribunal made the correct decision, but whether it made a decision according to the law.  Her dissatisfaction with the Tribunal’s findings, in circumstances where the Tribunal’s findings were reasonably open to it on what was before it, can only be seen as an attempt to challenge the Tribunal’s findings of fact, and to invite the Court to engage in impermissible merits review (Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Wu Shan Liang & Ors [1996] HCA 6;  (1996) 185 CLR 259). Conclusion  The grounds of the application are not made out. It is appropriate in the circumstances to dismiss the application. I will make an order accordingly.

       " 'SZUYI v Minister for Immigration & Anor [2015] FCCA 2642 (14 October 2015)': ' Introduction  The applicant applies for an order under s.477(2) of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) (Act) to extend the time prescribed by s.477(1) of the Act for making an application to this Court for a remedy under s.476 of the Act in relation to a decision made by the second respondent (Tribunal).  The application under s.477(2) of the Act is necessary because the Tribunal made its decision on 1 April 2014, and the applicant filed his application for judicial review on 22 August 2014. The applicant, therefore, is some 108 days out of time. Principles for extending time under s.477(2)  Under s.477(2) of the Act, the Court may order the extension of the 35 day time period if satisfied of two things. First, the application for such order has been made in writing to the Court, specifying why the applicant considers it is necessary in the interests of the administration of justice to make the order. Second, the Court is satisfied it is necessary in the interests of the administration of justice to make such order. In SZRIQ v Federal Magistrates Court of Australia Foster J said:[1] [47] The courts have developed guidelines as to the factors which might ordinarily be taken into account in considering the interests of the administration of justice in this context. Commonly, those factors include: (a)  Whether there has been a reasonable and adequate explanation for the applicant’s delay; (b)  Whether there is any prejudice to the Minister; (c)  Whether the applicant’s substantive case for judicial review is sufficiently arguable to justify the extension of time. [48] The factors to which I have referred at [47] above, although commonly deployed by judges when considering extensions of time of the character under consideration in the present case, are not prescribed under the relevant statutory provision (s 477(2)(b) of the Act) and cannot be said to exhaust all potentially relevant factors in every case. They are simply sensible guidelines developed by the courts which have utility in most cases. In most cases, the most significant factor will be whether there is any merit in the claim the applicant wishes to make if an extension of time were granted. As was said by Murphy J in SZQGO v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship & Anor in the context of extending time for making an appeal, the “Court should not exercise its discretion to extend time to bring an appeal, even for a short period, if an appeal has no prospect of success”.[2] Explanation for delay In the section headed “Grounds of application for time” the application states: “I was not aware that I have good grounds to appeal”. At the hearing, when I drew this ground to his attention, the applicant, who is not legally represented, said that the application was prepared by a solicitor. The applicant was otherwise unable to say anything about the ground for seeking an extension of time stated in the application. The ground for extension of time stated in the application, unadorned by any additional information, does not constitute a reasonable or adequate explanation for the applicant’s delay. I did ask the applicant why he did not file his application within the 35 day period. The applicant said his solicitor did not advise him of any time limit. Assuming that is so, it does not constitute an adequate explanation for delay. It is not unreasonable to expect lay persons to make inquiries of their lawyers about legal avenues that may be open to them after they become aware of an adverse decision by the Tribunal and by when such legal avenues are available to be pursued.  Notwithstanding the absence of any adequate explanation for the delay, I would place no weight on the applicant’s delay if I were to be satisfied the application the applicant filed would have merit if I were to make an order under s.477(2) of the Act. To determine that question, will be necessary to set out the applicant’s claims and the Tribunal’s reasons for not accepting those claims. Applicant’s claims for protection  The applicant is a citizen of Lebanon. In his application for a Protection visa, the applicant claimed he is a non-practising Sunni Muslim, and a homosexual. [3] He claimed that when he was 14 years of age he was sexually harassed by his employer. Since that day “the feeling towards male started with me”.[4] The applicant was unable to speak about these feelings to anyone, not even his parents. After the age of 17, the applicant accepted his situation and his attraction towards males. He secretly had three relationships with males and lived a lie. The applicant left Lebanon when his parents started planning for his marriage and started choosing the nominees to marry him. The applicant wanted to come to Australia to live his life as he wanted without fear of being harmed or killed if his situation were to be discovered. Before the Tribunal, the applicant gave evidence of the relationships he claimed he had beginning when he was 17 years of age. He claimed that his first relationship was with a classmate. He said they had sex in the toilets during recess every week or every two weeks for the whole school year which was about nine months. The applicant’s friends informed him that the person had been caught and that the applicant should stay away from him because he was gay. The second person with whom the applicant claimed he had a homosexual relationship with was a customer he met in 2009 at the barber shop where the applicant worked. The applicant maintained contact with the second person until he left Lebanon for Australia in 2012. The applicant and the second person visited a gay nightclub in Beirut “three to four times” together, and would return home at “12 or 1.30 am in the morning”.[5] The third person with whom the applicant claimed he had a relationship with was introduced to the applicant by the second person. All three of them went out together. The applicant claimed that he kept these relationships and his sexuality a secret from his family and also from the broader Tripoli society as he feared “being harmed or killed”.[6] Before the Tribunal, the applicant claimed that since his arrival in Australia he has had further homosexual relationships and has been open with others in the Lebanese community about his sexuality. The applicant asserted this newfound freedom has put him in further danger, as his family and community in Lebanon have been informed about his sexuality and relationships and continue to threaten him. Tribunal’s decision   The Tribunal found the applicant’s claims “lacked credibility”, that he was not a “reliable, credible or truthful witness”, and that “he fabricated his entire claim in order to be granted a protection visa”.[7] The Tribunal did not accept the applicant’s account of his first relationship in Lebanon. The Tribunal found it “implausible” that no one would have noticed two classmates having sex in the school toilets during recess on a “weekly or fortnightly” basis;[8]  the applicant claimed the relationship with the first person was secret, yet before the Tribunal the applicant said the applicant’s friends warned him to stay away from the first person because he was gay; the applicant showed no concern for the first person after he was informed the first person was caught for being gay; and the applicant was confused about “when the relationship ended and how it related to the end of the school year”.[9] The Tribunal also did not accept the applicant had a relationship with the second person. The “chance encounter” with a customer of his barber shop “was coincidental”;[10]  despite claiming to face death if his sexuality was discovered the applicant visited gay nightclubs, attended bathhouses and went for coffee with his second partner even though the applicant claimed the second person was “obviously gay from the way that he looked and talked”.[11] The Tribunal also did not accept the applicant had a homosexual relationship with the third person because the applicant claimed the third person was introduced to the applicant by the second person, and the Tribunal did not accept the applicant had a relationship with the second person. The Tribunal considered its conclusions strengthened by the absence of any photographic evidence of the applicant together with the three people he claimed to have had a homosexual relationship, or of any emails or other correspondence. The Tribunal also found that the applicant’s having visited in Australia in 2009 and 2010 to be inconsistent with his claim that since 2007 he lived in fear in Lebanon because of his homosexuality. The Tribunal did not accept the applicant’s explanation that he was unaware he could apply for protection. The applicant had been in Australia for periods of three months on each occasion which would have allowed him to seek information about his rights to protection.[12] The Tribunal also was not satisfied the applicant was the victim of any sexual assault. The Tribunal did not accept the applicant had exhibited any evidence that he pursued a homosexual lifestyle in Australia, either during his present or previous two visits. The applicant had no record of interacting with, or trying to establish contacts with the gay community in Sydney.  The Tribunal referred to country information that indicates there is an active scene for Arabic-speaking gays in Sydney. For that reason, the Tribunal did not accept the applicant’s explanation for his lack of interaction, namely lack of English. The Tribunal gave no weight to the evidence provided by friends of the applicant in support of his claims because they had no “direct knowledge” of the applicant’s homosexuality other than that he had told them he was gay.[13] The Tribunal also disregarded the submission made by the applicant’s representative that the applicant was merely “being cautious in Australia”.[14]  Ultimately, on consideration of the applicant’s claims, individually and cumulatively, the Tribunal was not satisfied that the applicant met the criterion under s.36(2)(a) of Act.[15] On this basis, the Tribunal was also not satisfied that there are substantial grounds for believing that the applicant faced a real risk of significant harm and accordingly found that he failed to satisfy the complementary protection criterion under s.36(2)(aa) of the Act.[16] Grounds of application  The application contains one ground of review:  1. I do not agree with the RRT decision, on the basis that the Tribunal did not give me a fair and reasonable hearing. By itself, there is no merit in this ground. It does not identify the matters which it is claimed rendered the hearing before the Tribunal not to be fair or reasonable.  At the hearing, the ground was translated to the applicant and I invited the applicant to make submissions in relation to this ground. The applicant submitted that the Tribunal did not believe anything the applicant said, and that the applicant had spoken the truth. The applicant said that his solicitor drafted the ground after the applicant told his solicitor he was not satisfied with the Tribunal’s decision. These matters do not raise any arguable case of jurisdictional error. Whether or not the Tribunal believed the applicant’s claims was a matter for the Tribunal. It is beyond argument that it was open to the Tribunal not to accept the applicant was a witness of truth for the reasons the Tribunal gave. I also drew to the applicant’s attention the statement he made in paragraph 3 of his affidavit he filed with his application, namely, that he wished to have the Tribunal’s decision reviewed “on the basis of natural justice”. This paragraph was translated to the applicant and I invited him to make submissions in relation to it. The applicant said he left Lebanon because Lebanon is not fair, there is no justice there, and he wished to see justice here. When I asked the applicant whether he understood what the words “natural justice” meant, the applicant said “the truth”. From the applicant’s submissions, it is apparent he did not understand paragraph 3 of his affidavit. In any event, paragraph 3 raises no arguable case that the Tribunal denied the applicant procedural fairness. Given the delegate did not accept the applicant’s claims, there can be no doubt that the applicant was on notice that his credibility would be in issue before the Tribunal. That it was in issue was made apparent by the questions the Tribunal asked the applicant. Thus, for example, the Tribunal asked the applicant how nobody noticed two boys having sex in the toilets during recess at a boys school, given the need for people to go to the toilet;[17] the Tribunal put to the applicant that it was reasonable to expect him to know what month and year he finished school;[18] the Tribunal put to the applicant that the applicant claimed he lived in fear of being gay in Lebanon since 2007, yet he had come to Australia in 2009 and 2010 yet did not apply for a Protection visa;[19] and the Tribunal said it had concerns the applicant had no record of interacting with the gay community in Australia.[20] Other matters At the hearing before me, the applicant submitted that he had been let down by lawyers whose only interest was to charge him fees. He submitted his lawyers did not give him the right guidance in his case before the Tribunal. They did not advise him how to prepare for the case. The applicant also submitted that he was affected by his mother’s illness and by the fact that he has been unable to work in Australia. None of these matters, however, raises any arguable case of jurisdictional error.  Conclusion and disposition I am not satisfied it is necessary in the interests of the administration of justice that the time for filing the application be extended. I propose, therefore, to dismiss the application for an extension of time. I will hear the parties on the question of costs.I certify that the preceding twenty-five (25) paragraphs are a true copy of the reasons for judgment of Judge ManousaridisAssociate:  Date:  14 October 2015 [1] [2013] FCA 1284;  (2013) 139 ALD 252 at  [47])[2] [2012] FCA 177;  (2012) 125 ALD 449 at  [29][3] CB28[4] CB28[5] CB114, [15][6] CB28[7] CB117, [36][8] CB117, [37][9] CB114, [13][10] CB117, [39][11] CB114, [39][12] CB118, [41]-[42][13] CB116, [31][14] CB119, [47][15] CB119, [48], [51][16] CB119, [52][17] CB113-114, [10][18] CB114, [12][19] CB115, [14][20] CB116, [27]       ',\n",
       " 'SZUZZ v Minister for Immigration & Anor [2015] FCCA 1946 (17 July 2015)': \"  This is an application for judicial review of a decision of the second respondent (“Tribunal”) dated 14 August 2014. The Tribunal affirmed a decision of a delegate of the first respondent (“Minister”) to refuse to grant the applicant a protection visa. The applicant is a citizen of Uganda whose first language is Luganda. He claimed in summary that he feared persecution in Uganda as he was a member of the opposition Forum for Democratic Change (“FDC”) political party. He raised two grounds in this application: first, that the standard of interpretation at the second of three hearings conducted by the Tribunal was so inadequate that it denied him a fair hearing; and secondly, that the Tribunal erred by failing to take into account a newspaper report that, he claimed, was corroborative of his claims. For the reasons that follow neither of those grounds is made out and the application will be dismissed. Background  The applicant arrived in Australia on a Special Program (TE – 416) visa which was cancelled on 18 November 2011. On 28 November 2011 he applied for a protection visa. The following summary of those claims is taken from the applicant’s written submissions which are accepted by the Minister to be an accurate summary:  [12] The Applicant also made specific claims in his original application to the Department on the 28 November 2011:  (a) In August 2004, the applicant became involved in addressing the issue of excessive course tuition fees which was causing student anger. He was charged with the responsibility of mobilizing and leading students in a peaceful demonstration which started at the front of Macmaine and went to Constitution Square. On arrival there, the students were met by anti-riot police, army personnel and special military police who used various weapons- batons, AK47s and even armed vehicles – to disperse them. Some students sustained bullet injuries.  (b) The applicant was arrested and assaulted by the authorities because of his role in the demonstaration (sic). He and other students were taken by a police truck to an unknown location where he was beaten with wire whips, tortured and interrogated for a day and a night. He was released after being warned against further involvement in any demonstrations and after being forced to sign documents confessing to false accusations. He was also advised that he had been blacklisted and would sent to prison if arrested again.  (c)  In 2006, the applicant became a formal member of the FDC and was recruited as chairman of the FDC youth at Macmaine and became the focal point for party activities at the institute, conducting FDC rallies and assemblies there. He also became active in opposition politics against the Democratic Party (DP) and other parties at the university and national levels. On several occasions, the applicant and other students who were involved in peaceful demonstrators were rounded up by anti-riot police, jailed for few days and then released on bail.  (d) Shortly after completing his diploma at the end of 2006, the applicant was employed by Bukasa Telcom Uganda as an installation technician and then by Huawei Technologies Uganda as a technician. He was involved in maintain telecommunication masts around Uganda and in Burundi, Rwanda and Kenya. He also continued his political activities, attending meetings regularly.  (e) On 31 July 2010, while on duty for his company, the applicant was returning to Uganda across the Uganda-Malaba when he was stopped by the Uganda customs security (UPDF) at the checkpoint. When the officers saw from his passport that he travelled frequently to Burundi and Rwanda, they asked for his official work request. Because he did not have one, and even though he had company identification and a company car, they detained him on suspicion of making false statements to them about his reason for crossing the border. He was beaten and refused contact with his employer. While in UPDF custody he was tortured and interrogated about his work, travels across the border and political involvement and political opinion. He was accused of contacting and collaborating with members of the allied Democratic Forces (ADF) in Rwanda. He denied this and any interests in politics, although he stated that he was a supporter of the FDC. He was then further physically abused by soldiers and was warned against any involvement with the FDC or ADF. He was advised that he would be kept under constant surveillance. He was released and his documents were returned on payment of 50,000 Ugandan shillings, however he was told that he must no leave the country. He was also forced to sign a document which he was not allowed to read. He then drove to Tororo town to obtain medical treatment for his injuries. A friend drove him back to Kampala because he was so weak, and he then reported the incident to his employers who gave him leave to recover.  (f) From August to November 2010, the applicant was very frightened for his life. He considered quitting his job but did not want to live in poverty again. After he resumed work, he was spied on and received death threats over the phone. He systematically faced with targeted arrest and illegal detention and was falsely accused by different Ugandan security agents. On 31 August 2010, he was contacted by phone by a man who identified himself as a colonel from the Bombo military barracks and told him that he was required to attend an interview on account of the incident in July 2010. He said that he was under surveillance by the Ugandan military intelligence and could not run from the UPDF.  (g) On 11 September 2010, three men attacked him in his house. They arrested him, took into their car at gunpoint, and then beat him with the stocks of their guns and kicked him with steel-capped boots. They took him to an unknown destination, insulted him, physically abused him in various ways and kept questioning him about his affiliation with the FDC, his collaboration with the ADF rebels and his reason for refusing to join the ruling NRM (National Resistance Movement). He was also questioned again about his travels to other countries. Eventually he was driven somewhere and dropped on the side of the road.  (h) The applicant was fearful of returning home and decided to stay at the home of a neighbour. He then relocated to another house, kept a low public profile, changed his mobile phone number and concentrated on his work. He continued his political activities despite the danger, attending many FDC pre-election meetings.  (i) After the February 2011 presidential and parliamentary elections, the applicant was assigned as an FDC youth leader in the Ntinda area to mobilise and guide demonstrations to be held on 11 and 1 April 2011 which were known as the “Walk to Work” campaigns. During the first demonstrations, the Ugandan government sent armed military and police forces to intercept and attack the demonstrators. The applicant was beaten by soldiers but escape.  (j) During the second demonstration, smaller groups of protestors moved fro (sic) their home areas and converged in the city, with the applicant leading the Ntinda group. Again there was heavy deployment of anti-riot security forces which attacked the demonstrators. The applicant was beaten and arrested with other demonstrators and taken by military truck to an unknown destination. He and the others were tortured by near-drowning. The next day he was interrogated by three officers, one of whom was a public prosecutor and, he was told, would write a statement about him.  (k) After a total of two days in detention he was taken to the central police station where other Walk to Walk demonstrators were being held. On 19 April 2011, when of the police officers took pity on him and allowed the applicant to contact his family or friends. He was also advised that he would be appearing in court on charges of associating with a rebel organization, causing disorderliness, inciting violence and treason. He know he would be given life imprisonment or the death sentence on these charges.  (l) He appeared in court on the 21 April 2011 and was given legal representation which had been organized by the FDC, who spoke to him while he was in jail. He and the other “Walk to Work” captives denied all the charges of which they were accused. The applicant and some others were released on bail on the basis of poor health, however in passport was requested because he was banned from travelling; he told his representative that he had lost it although he still had it at home. He was required to return to court for another hearing on 30 May 2011, which was later rescheduled to 31 August 2011.  (m) After his release he received medical treatment and his friends advised him to leave the country. He noted that he was under surveillance all the time. He decided that he needed to escape Uganda to save himself. He had already begun looking for ways to leave at the end of 2010. A friend named Alex told him that a man he knew, named Joshua, could assist him. Joshua arranged for him to obtain a visa for Australia. He managed to skip his court hearing on 31 August and was helped by a friend of Alex, who worked at the airport, to pass through airport security on departing Uganda in 4 September 2011. When he arrived in Perth on 6 September 2011, he was met by people from “Youth with a Mission”. He realized he did not fit in with them. Two days later he met a Ugandan girl, told her about his problems, and they both travelled to Sydney where she told him that her friend Jeff could help him. A West African church leader in Perth also gave him a few hundred dollars to travel to Sydney.  (n) The applicant fears that, if he returns to Uganda, he will be arrested and killed because he has been accused of very serious offences and left before his court hearing.  (Errors in original) On 11 February 2013 a delegate of the Minister decided to refuse to grant the applicant a protection visa and the applicant applied to the Tribunal for review of that decision. On 11 September 2013 the applicant was invited to attend a hearing to be held by the Tribunal on 21 November 2013. Shortly before that hearing, the migration agent acting for the applicant sent a number of documents to the Tribunal including a newspaper article in Luganda regarding the Walk to Work campaign that the applicant claimed to have attended in 2011. The applicant attended the hearing before the Tribunal on 21 November 2013 and gave evidence over the course of approximately 3 hours with the assistance of an interpreter in the Luganda language. The hearing was adjourned to another day. It was initially to be held on 27 November 2013 but, at the request of the applicant’s adviser was fixed for 18 December 2013. In the meantime the applicant’s adviser requested, and was provided with, a copy of the recording of the first hearing. The applicant attended the second hearing on 18 December 2013 again with the assistance of an interpreter in the Luganda language. This hearing lasted approximately 3.5 hours. At the hearing the applicant gave the Tribunal a letter from a general practitioner indicating that “any interview should be done in stages with no more than 30 minutes, followed by a 5-minute break to allow him to do his breathing exercises & relax & get thoughts in order.” It will be necessary to return to some of the detail of the second hearing in due course. For present purposes it may be noted that there were some questions raised about the standard of interpretation at the hearing and that the Tribunal asked the applicant some questions relating to the newspaper article that had been provided by his agent. After the hearing the applicant’s agent asked for and was provided with a copy of the recording of the second hearing. In submissions to the Tribunal dated 24 January 2014 the applicant’s agent stated that a translator for the newspaper article had been unable to be obtained and that there had been serious interpretation issues in the second hearing. It noted that “on several occasions during the second hearing, the interpreter informed the Tribunal that she did not understand a particular word or phrase used by the applicant, and that she was not fluent in Luganda.” The submission went on to say that by “listening to the audio-recording of the second hearing, it is immediately apparent that there were significant inaccuracies, errors, and omissions made in the interpreting throughout the hearing.” However, there were no instances given of those inaccuracies errors or omissions. In the statutory declaration accompanying the agent’s submissions, the applicant said in respect of the second hearing that:  [7] I did not feel that the Luganda interpreter was very good. She did not understand some of the language I was using and she could not express what I was saying properly. I know this as my English is quite good.  [8] For example, when I used the word “incite” during the hearing she did not know how to translate it to Luganda.  [9] Also, when I was explaining that I was accused of supporting the ADF rebels, she said that I was supporting the rebels. This is a very significant difference for my case. I worry that there were other instances like this in my second hearing that I may not have picked up on.  (Emphasis in the original) It may be noted that this statutory declaration, like every other statement made by the applicant in support of his claims, was in English and that there is no indication that it had been translated for the applicant. In light of the concerns raised about the standard of interpretation at the second hearing, the applicant was invited to and did attend a third hearing conducted by the Tribunal on 18 June 2014. Once again, the applicant gave evidence at this hearing with the assistance of a Luganda interpreter. The Tribunal made its decision on 14 August 2014 affirming the decision of the delegate. Tribunal’s decision  The Tribunal had significant concerns about the applicant’s evidence at the second hearing. However, the Tribunal stated that its concerns about the third hearing alone led to such significant concerns about the applicant’s credibility that it found that he was not a witness of truth and that he was prepared to say anything to obtain a protection visa. It noted that, in addition to and independently of those concerns, it had concerns about the applicant’s evidence at the first and second hearings which also indicated that he was not a witness of truth and had fabricated his claims. The Tribunal explained its concerns arising from the evidence at the third hearing as follows: there were inconsistencies between the applicant’s claimed experiences of arrest and torture in 2010 and the evidence from his passport which showed that, contrary to his other evidence, the applicant had travelled from Uganda to Kenya at that time; the fact that the applicant chose to continue with the very work that had given rise to the authorities’ suspicions about him and was warned not to leave the country because he would be under constant surveillance was inconsistent with his claim to fear harm; similarly, the fact that the applicant continued with the same work after having been attacked, arrested, blindfolded, threatened with death and severely beaten in connection with the travel associated with his work made his claim to fear harm not credible; the applicant voluntarily attended a Court hearing in May 2011 even though he faced charges against him which carried either a life sentence or a death sentence; and the applicant’s delay in leaving Uganda was inconsistent with his having experienced a genuine fear of harm there. In addition to those matters, the Tribunal outlined six other bases upon which it rejected his claims as lacking credibility. Those reasons included a number of occasions at the hearings at which he gave inconsistent evidence, such as stating on one occasion that his mother was unable to pay his tuition fees and on another occasion stating that she had paid them. The Tribunal also had regard to the documentary and other corroborative evidence relied upon by the applicant, saying that it had weighed up the documents but because of evidence, and the applicant’s admission, the documents could be obtained by bribery and because of its other concerns with the applicant’s credibility, it was not prepared to give any weight to those documents from Uganda. In respect of the newspaper article, the Tribunal noted that it had been unable to find the article online and that, in spite of being given the opportunity to obtain the original article the applicant was unable to do so. Those reasons, together with the fact that the applicant’s name was a common name and on the basis of his lack of credibility in general, the Tribunal was not prepared to accept that the article was genuine and that even if it was it did not give it any weight. The Tribunal then had regard to evidence that was contained in medical and psychological reports relied upon by the applicant and, noted that while it was prepared to accept the diagnosis in February 2012 that the applicant suffered severe stress, anxiety and depression and that he had been diagnosed with PTSD. However, it did not accept that he had experienced harm in Uganda simply because he had told his doctor and psychologist that he had. The Tribunal summarised its credibility findings as follows:  [63] Considering the matters from the third hearing as discussed initially above, and taking into account the documents and corroborative evidence matters discussed above (and in the Annexure), the concerns the Tribunal holds about the applicant’s credibility lead the Tribunal to conclude that the applicant is not a witness of truth and the applicant has fabricated an account of events upon which he has based his protection claims. On the basis of that conclusion, the Tribunal rejected all of the applicant’s factual claims and found that he did not satisfy the criteria for the grant of a protection visa. Consideration  Before turning to the grounds relied upon by the applicant, it is worth noting several procedural matters. The application for judicial review was filed on 3 September 2014 and listed for a first Court date on 17 November 2014. On that day the Court made various directions for the preparation of evidence and for the filing and serving of any amended application and listed the matter for the call over on 6 February 2015. In the meantime, the matter was transferred to my docket. On 6 February 2015 I ordered that the matter be listed for hearing on 2 April 2015. That date was later changed to 14 April 2015.  By application in a case filed on 1 April 2015 the applicant sought the hearing date be vacated in order for the applicant to be able to engage an expert to give evidence about the interpretation at the second hearing and also that he be given leave to file a further amended application. Those orders were made by consent on 2 April 2015 and the matter listed for hearing on 9 June 2015 before me. On 9 April 2015 the applicant filed a further amended application raising four grounds. He now only presses the first and third of those grounds namely that the Tribunal made a jurisdictional error in denying the applicant procedural fairness, and by failing to take into account relevant considerations when determining the truthfulness of the applicant’s evidence. On 24 April 2015 the applicant filed two affidavits in support of his application. The first, by himself and the second by a Siddique Panwala, the manager of an agency called Universal Interpreters and Translators. On 5 May 2015 the applicant filed an affidavit which annexed the transcript of the second and third Tribunal hearings. At the hearing, Mr Fozzard, counsel for the applicant, read each of the affidavits filed in the matter but conceded that, on the basis of that evidence, he was unable to establish any particular instance of misinterpretation or lack of interpretation. When I explained to him that this might constitute a significant barrier to any success in respect of the first ground, he accepted that that might be the case but was content to rely on the evidence as it stood including the statement of reasons prepared by the Tribunal. I note these matters because the first ground will be rejected on the basis of the evidence before the Court, and in spite of the applicant’s awareness of the inadequacy of that evidence, he made no application for an adjournment in order to remedy that situation. That being said, I turn now to consider each of the remaining grounds in the application. Ground 1  The applicant’s primary contention in respect of this ground was that, at the second hearing the applicant did not understand the questions that were being put to him, and hence his responses at the second hearing were not responsive. He argued that this constituted a denial of procedural fairness that was not remedied by the Tribunal holding a third hearing. The applicant also argued that the standard of interpreting at the second hearing was so incompetent that the applicant was effectively prevented from giving his evidence. Further, he argued that errors made in interpretation were material to adverse findings by the Tribunal and that this constituted a breach of s.425 of the Act in line with the authority in Perera v Minister for Immigration & Multicultural Affairs [1999] FCA 507;  (1999) 92 FCR 6. In support of these contentions the applicant, in his affidavit, stated that “there were significant inaccuracies, errors and omissions made in the interpreting throughout the second hearing conducted on the 18 December 2013.” He submitted in his written submissions that such errors were evident in the transcript. However at the hearing before me, the applicant took me to no part of the transcript and, as I have noted, frankly conceded that no part of the transcript could support the assertion in the applicant’s affidavit because it did not purport to be anything other than a transcription of what was said in English at the hearing. The applicant also said in his affidavit that he “never understood what was asked at the second hearing”. The applicant also argued at the hearing before me that the Tribunal’s reasons themselves established that the difficulties with interpretation had a material impact upon its decision. In particular on the following paragraphs of the Tribunal’s decision:  [15] The Tribunal has not accepted that the applicant’s evidence was adversely affected by his mental health in any of the hearings (for reasons set out later in this decision and/or the Annexure A). The Tribunal notes that the applicant complained about the standard of interpreting at the second hearing. The Tribunal has significant concerns about the applicant’s evidence at the second hearing, however it has found that his evidence, and its concerns from the third hearing alone, led to such significant concerns about his credibility that that (sic) he is not a witness of truth, and is prepared to say anything to obtain a protection visa.  [16] The Tribunal also considers, additionally to and independently of the concerns arising from the third hearing, that its concerns about the applicant’s evidence at the first and second hearings further indicate that he is not a witness of truth and has fabricated his claims. The Tribunal’s concerns, leading to an advert’s credibility finding, are set out below.  (Emphasis in original) The applicant also relied upon the following passage in the Annexure A to the Tribunal’s decision:  [91] The Tribunal noted that the interpreter correctly pointed out there were occasions when she did not understand a word used by the applicant. The Tribunal suggested that the hearing continue, and that the applicant could continue to use the interpreter, and if there was a word she could not interpret, he could attempt to explain this in English. The Tribunal is satisfied that the applicant was able to communicate, for the most part, in Luganda and with the interpreter, and when necessary, effectively in English, noting that there were occasions when the applicant and his agent made objections, which were then dealt with. The Minister argued that the evidence relied upon by the applicant did not establish that the interpreter at the second hearing was incompetent, that the applicant was prevented from giving his evidence by such incompetence, or that any mistranslations were “so material as to cause decision making process to miscarry”. The principles relating to the standard of interpretation for the purposes of review by the Tribunal were summarised by Griffiths J in SZSEI v Minister for Immigration & Border Protection [2014] FCA 465 at  [71] – [81]. I gratefully adopt that summary and, for present purposes, need only note the following: the general approach to be taken in cases reason the application of section 425 of the Act is that described by Ryan J in WALN  v Minister for Immigration & Multicultural & Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCAFC 131 at  [29]:  To succeed on this ground the appellant must establish that he was effectively prevented from giving his evidence... Alternatively, he must establish that errors had occurred in translation which were so material as to cause the decision-making process to miscarry. ... the first part of that statement should not be understood to mean that the applicant must be prevented from giving any evidence but rather as being reference to matters of significance involving important issues: see SZRMQ v Minister for Immigration & Border Protection [2013] FCAFC 142 at  [22] and [23]. there is no need to show a causal connection between the mistranslation and the decision-maker’s ultimate conclusion only that the mistranslation could have had significance: SZRMQ at [25]; and the question of whether there was inadequate interpretation involves a qualitative assessment of the conduct of the hearing before the Tribunal as a whole: SZHEW v Minister for Immigration & Citizenship [2009] FCA 783 at  [52]. It should also be recalled that the onus of establishing any jurisdictional error falls upon an applicant in proceedings for judicial review: Minister for Immigration & Citizenship v SZGUR  (2011) 241 CLR 594 at 616 [67] per Gummow J; and SZJBD v Minister for Immigration & Citizenship [2009] FCAFC 106;  (2009) 179 FCR 109 at 124  [71] per Buchanan J. The first ground relies on two factual assertions: first that there were significant inaccuracies, errors and omissions in the interpretation at the second hearing; and secondly, that the applicant did not understand what was being said at that hearing. Neither of those assertions is made out on the evidence. Dealing first with the applicant’s apparent inability to understand anything, the following may be noted: first, the applicant’s affidavit in these proceedings was in English and there was nothing to suggest that the affidavit had been translated for him before he executed it. I note that r.15.27(2) of the Federal Circuit Court Rules 2001 (Cth) requires that if a person making an affidavit does not have an adequate command of English then a translation of it and the oath or affirmation must be read or given in writing to the person in the language that the person understands and that the translator must certify in or below the juror that he or she has done so. I raised this fact with Mr Fozzard at the hearing and gave him the opportunity of obtaining instructions. He informed me, after having obtained those instructions, that while the applicant understands some English, reading and signing an affidavit in a solicitor’s office is a different matter to understanding questions at a hearing. While I accept that submission, I reject the applicant’s evidence that he did not understand anything. That is not only because of the fact that his affidavits were in English but because of the matters that follow. Secondly, as already noted, each of the applicant’s statements made in support of his protection visa application were in English and there is no evidence to suggest that they were translated to him before he signed them. Thirdly, although this is a matter to which I give far less weight, in his protection visa application the applicant indicated that he spoke, read and wrote English. Fourthly, as will be seen from the extract of the transcript of the second hearing set out below, the applicant clearly understood relevant parts of the questions asked by the Tribunal in English. The applicant understood, and was able to answer some of those questions in English and on several occasions was able to correct the interpretation given by the interpreter. Fifthly, in his statutory declaration made after the second hearing, the applicant himself said that he was aware that the interpreter did not understand some of the language and that this was because his English was quite good. Sixthly, as noted by the Tribunal the applicant had successfully undertaken a number of courses in English in Australia and obtained qualifications including advocating in English on behalf of aged care clients: see [90] of the Tribunal’s reasons. All of these matters are important to the qualitative analysis of the interpretation that was given at the hearing. Critically, as explained by Allsop CJ in SZRMQ, the Court must have regard to the process and determine whether it is, as a whole, fair. It is not the case, as appears to have been submitted by Mr Fozzard, that simply because there is an interpreter, the applicant’s own ability in English is irrelevant to the determination of those issues. As I have noted, Mr Fozzard conceded at the hearing that he was unable to point to any particular incident of inaccuracy, error or omission in the interpretation. In my view, that concession could be sufficient to dispose of the first ground. However, as the transcript was in evidence before me, I have had regard to it in order to determine whether the assertions made by the applicant in respect of the level of interpretation were made out. I have concluded that they are not. The transcript does reveal that there was some truth in the applicant’s complaints to the Tribunal about the quality of the interpretation. The following extracts reveal that on a number of occasions the interpreter was unable to interpret particular words and on two occasions made some mistakes in interpreting what the applicant had said. However, that is insufficient to justify any conclusion that the interpretation was of a standard that it denied the applicant the opportunity required by s.425 of the Act. The first passage in the transcript is at pp.27-29:  Female Interpreter: If he goes back they’ll reopen a case against him for supporting rebel groups,  Applicant: Inciting violence  Female Interpreter: Inciting violence   Applicant: [Foreign Language]  Female Interpreter: and joining walk to work.  Applicant: [Foreign Language]  Female Interpreter: I don’t know if I can tell that in English.  Female Agent: I think I can try to –   Applicant: Yeah, I think I can try to –  Female Interviewer: I’ll just let your agent speak, yes?  Female Agent: It seems like there are some interpreting problems.  Female Interviewer: Okay, I think that’s right, there are some interpreting problems, however, I think that it seems, because your understanding of English is so good you’re also understanding of there’s a problem picking up on that and we’re talking about it. Does that seem fair or does that not seem?  Female Interpreter: Can I say something?  Female Interviewer: Yes.  Female Interpreter: Can he try if he understands you better, can he try to express what – because there are some words that I don’t understand in Luganda that I cannot express, but if he can express them in English the way he understands them, can he try that?  Female Interviewer: If you let us know what word you don’t understand that might work, okay? So how does that sounds if we go with that?  Applicant: It’s hard for me but I can try.  Female Interviewer: What is hard for you?  Applicant: I express myself well in Luganda.  Female Interpreter: It’s hard to express yourself in Luganda?  Applicant: No it’s easier for me to express myself in Luganda because I understand it better and so I can try to –   Female Interviewer: I understand that what the interpreter is saying is that she’s having difficulties with some words, not the whole thing but with some words –   Applicant: And those words are the ones which are important to me because they are the right words –  Female Interviewer: Then every time we get to such a word, we’ll stop and we’ll see how we go, okay? Okay. Alright. So there was a particular word just then that was not understood yes?  Female Interpreter: [Foreign Language]  Applicant: [Foreign Language]  Female Interpreter: He understands everything, it’s only that I don’t understand, I don’t know how to express some of the words.  Female Interviewer: There was one word that got us stuck, do you remember what that was? So we will start again on that.  Female Interpreter: Can we start again on that?  Female Interviewer: Do you know what the word was where you got suck, where the interpreter got stuck?  Applicant: [Foreign Language]  Female Interpreter: [Foreign Language]  Applicant: [Foreign Language]  Female Interpreter: Because you asked why doesn’t he want to go back?  Female Interviewer: Mm-hm. Yeah. Sorry, there was a word that you said she wasn’t interpreting properly, do you remember what word that was? You don’t remember. Do you remember or you don’t?   Applicant: No, I don’t remember.  Female Interviewer: Okay, you said if you go back they’ll reopen a case for supporting rebel groups and inciting violence and, and then that was the word.  Applicant: No inciting a violence. Inciting  Female Interpreter: Inciting.  Applicant: Yes.  Female Interviewer: That’s what I said, inciting violence.  Female Interpreter: That’s what he said inciting violence.   Female Interviewer: What was the next thing? That’s where the word was – there was a problem.   Applicant: [Foreign Language]  Female Interpreter: And putting himself or –   Applicant: Not putting, not putting –  Female Interviewer: That’s the word. Yes. This is, this is where we had the problem.   Applicant: It’s not putting myself... I was there.  Female Interpreter: In what way?  Applicant: [Foreign Language]  Female Interviewer: You mean present?  Applicant: Yes.  Female Interpreter: You were in the group of walk to work.  Applicant: Yes. [Foreign Language](Errors in original)  It may be noted that the difficulties experienced by the interpreter only related to “some of the words” and that those difficulties were met by the practical solution of the applicant giving that evidence in English. There is no suggestion in the evidence that that evidence by the applicant was somehow affected by the interpreter. Similarly this extract shows that the interpreter was corrected by the applicant in English in respect of the word “inciting”. This supports my conclusion that the applicant had some understanding of English and this enabled him to overcome any difficulties that the interpreter experienced in interpreting his words in Luganda. The second relevant extract is at pp.32-34 of the transcript:   Tribunal Member: What do you want to say? Because you need to say it, because it's on recording.  Applicant: Something I can try to help myself but –   Tribunal Member: What do you want to say?  Applicant: Female Interpreter doesn't understand -  Tribunal Member: Is the Female Interpreter accredited Luganda speaker?  Female Interviewer: Okay, just hold on one second I'll ask that question in a moment. However, I just- Okay. You clearly do speak English. Okay. I don't want to ask you to continue to do it in English but I think you do understand what I'm asking which is about how many youth leaders are there in the FDC in Uganda, do you understand the question in English or not?  Applicant: Yes, I understand that.  Female Interviewer: Okay. Are there about 200 youth leaders in the FDC in Uganda?   Applicant: Can you [inaudible]?  Female Interviewer: How many youth leaders are there in the FDC in Uganda? Do you understand that question?  Applicant: Yes.  Female Interviewer: Okay.  Applicant: What I know each district has a youth leader and each district has other counties like - so I don't know the exact number.  Female Interviewer: That's okay, but you are saying approximately?   Applicant: Yeah, maybe approximately.  Female Interviewer: Okay. So in terms of your question about the accreditation I don't know, I'll check. So your question is, is the interpreter -  Tribunal Member: It would just seem to me that this interpreter is not fluent in Luganda and there's a real communication issues arising today. The last hearing the interpreter was remarkably different and it can translate Luganda.  Female Interviewer: Okay, Madam Interpreter, I'm not sure of the qualifications. Just hold on please. Do you want to have a break and we can have a discussion?  Female Interpreter: That's fine.  Female Interviewer: Okay, we'll have a break? Okay, we'll have a break and I'll find out the interpreter's accreditation. So we'll have a five minute break. Madam Interpreter if you can just stay for a moment?  Female Interpreter: Okay.  Female Interviewer: Thank you. Madam Interpreter so what I'm going to do is I'm just going to get the hearings tape, so if you can maybe go to the front desk, the reception and we're just going to talk about the accreditation, okay so someone will see you at the front desk.  Female Interpreter: Can I say something before I go?  Female Interviewer: Okay, just the applicant's not in the room –   Female Interpreter: Can I say something before I go?  Female Interviewer: Can you say it to the hearing's team? Is that okay?  Female Interpreter: Yeah, to the hearing's team and to you because -  Female Interviewer: They can convey it to me, it's just that we really don't have a conversation in the absence of the applicant, okay?  Female Interpreter: Because I really understand what you're saying it's only that he does not understand the way of answering the questions.  Female Interviewer: Okay, I'm just going to pause the recording and we're just going to get the interpreter to go to the front desk, okay, all right and we're just going to take a short journey.  Female Tribunal Member: This hearing is resumed. The time is 2:47 in the afternoon. The tribunal members and all other parties are in the room.  Female Interviewer: Okay, thank you. Okay. So before the break there was an issue raised about whether they are interpreting problems. My understanding is that there is no accreditation for Luganda so she can't be accredited. This interpreter has been used in immigration before and has been used in the tribunal before. My understanding is that there are some words that she doesn't understand, that happen often in hearings, not every single word is going to be interpreted. Always, an interpreter doesn't always understand every single word. So what I'd like to do is I'd like to proceed if there's a word that's not been identified, sorry that's not been interpreted properly and it seems that there is a problem then we can work with that. Alright? My understanding as well is that you've done - how many courses have you done in English?  Applicant: I think I've done-- I can't remember, but a couple of them.  Female Interviewer: Okay. You provided a number of courses, it looks like you've been - you've had, you've done the course and you've been successfully. That was at general construction induction training, [inaudible 17:16] train age care, work safety in the construction industry, applied first aid and you've also studied things in English like solving a range of problems, investigating the chemical nature of matter, investigating biological processes. There's a lot that you've produced and a lot of study that you've done in English. Is that correct that you've done that study in English?  Applicant: That's correct.  Female Interviewer: All right. So what I would like to do is I would like to proceed, continue using the interpreter, if there's a word that she doesn't understand then she can let us know, we'll see if we can work around that word in English. Okay, how does that sound?  Applicant: That's fine.  Female Interviewer: All right. Is that fine with you?   Female Interpreter: Sure.  (Errors in original) Once again this extract shows that the applicant was able to fill gaps in the interpretation in English by his own evidence and further, that he agreed to the rather practical suggestion made by the Tribunal that if there were any further difficulties he could let the Tribunal know and they could “work around that word in English”. I conclude that, while there were 12 difficulties in the interpretation at the second hearing, those difficulties did not deny the applicant any opportunity to give evidence in support of his claims or to present arguments in accordance with the right provided by s.425 of the Act. For that reason, the first ground is rejected. Ground 3  This ground concerns the way in which the Tribunal dealt with the newspaper article written in Luganda. It is based upon the evidence of the applicant in his affidavit that there were errors and omissions in the interpretation of the article to the Tribunal and the assertion in that affidavit that the Tribunal should have asked for it to be translated at the third hearing and asked him questions about it when the correct interpreter was present. However, the applicant has not established that there were any errors or omissions in the interpretation of the article and has not undermined any of the reasons given by the Tribunal at [50] - [53] of its reasons for not accepting that the article was genuine or, alternatively not giving it any weight. In short, the Tribunal clearly took into account in the sense that it had regard to the material, analysed its contents and gave weight to it according to that analysis. For those reasons, the third ground is rejected. Conclusion  There is no jurisdictional error in the Tribunal’s decision. The application is dismissed with costs. I certify that the preceding fifty-five (55) paragraphs are a true copy of the reasons for judgment of Judge SmithAssociate:  Date: 17 July 2015       \",\n",
       " 'SZVDE v Minister for Immigration & Anor [2015] FCCA 2875 (21 October 2015)': ' Introduction   The applicant, a citizen of the People’s Republic of China, seeks judicial review of a decision made by the second respondent (Tribunal) affirming the decision of a delegate of the first respondent (Minister) not to grant the applicant a Protection visa.  The application was lodged after the 35 day period prescribed by s.477(1) of the Migration Act 1958 (Act).  In his application, the applicant applies for an extension of time.  The Minister does not oppose the Court making an order under 477(2) of the Act extending the time by which the applicant had to commence these proceedings.  It was clear from the date on which the matter was set down for hearing – that is to say, 29 October 2014 – that the Minister would take that position because on that day the matter was set down for final hearing.   Given the relatively short delay in the applicant’s making his application and the evidence, which I accept, which shows the  Tribunal did not arrange to send its decision to the applicant within 35 days of its decision, I am satisfied that it is in the interests of the administration of justice that an order should be made under s.477(2)  of the Act to extend the time prescribed by subsection s.477(1) of the Act for the applicant making his application up to and including 23 September 2014, being the day on which the applicant filed his application. I then turn to the application for judicial review that is before the Court.  Before I identify and consider the grounds on which the applicant seeks judicial review of the Tribunal’s decision, it will be necessary to set out the applicant’s claims for protection and the reasons for which the Tribunal did not accept those claims.   Applicant’s claims for protection  The applicant’s claims for protection were set out in a statement that accompanied the applicant’s application for a Protection visa.  He claimed that he fled China because he protected a Falun Gong practitioner (Mr G) and he feared that he would be persecuted for that reason if he returns to China.  The asserted facts on which the applicant relied for those claims are as follows. In August 2005 the applicant had arranged to meet Mr G at 10 am in front of Mr G’s building to play tenpin bowling.  When Mr G failed to appear, and after he unsuccessfully attempted to call Mr G, the applicant “went to his home to see him”. The applicant knocked on Mr G’s door and, when he received no answer, he pushed the door open and entered the room.  Mr G got out of his bedroom “with panic”.  Mr G closed the door and told the applicant he was practising Falun Gong.  The applicant became “scared” on hearing this news and told Mr G that Falun Gong had been “denounced by [the Chinese] government[to be] an evil cult”, and that Mr G should be “more cautious”. On 10 January 2009, late at night, the applicant heard a knock at his door.  He opened it to find Mr G, who quickly entered the applicant’s home.  Mr G told the applicant “with a panic” that Mr G and two other Falun Gong practitioners encountered Public Order Joint Defence Force while putting Falun Gong-related leaflets into mailboxes.  Mr G told the applicant that one of the practitioners was caught and Mr G did not dare return to his home, but requested he stay at the applicant’s home.  The applicant agreed.  Mr G stayed at the applicant’s home for three days, after which the applicant took Mr G to a long distance bus station and gave him some money.  After Mr G left, the applicant “felt nervous every day”.  On 13 January 2009 while at work the applicant was arrested and taken to the police station.  He was placed in an interrogation room and he was questioned by two policemen who asked him if he had contacted Mr G recently.  The applicant replied, “not for some time.”  Dissatisfied with the applicant’s answer, the policemen beat him and forced him to crouch until he collapsed to the ground.  The applicant was released after 24 hours “because of lack of evidence”.   On 14 January 2009 the applicant was informed by his wife that the police had searched their house.  The applicant was horrified at the action of the police and he was worried Mr G would be caught and confess to police.  On advice from his wife, the applicant asked an agent to apply for a visa to Australia in March 2009.  While in Australia, in August 2011, the police searched the applicant’s home in China and took his wife to the police station for investigation.  The applicant’s wife, who could “not stand threat and beating of police” told them that the applicant had helped Mr G. The police asked the applicant’s wife to tell the applicant he was requested to return to China for “assistance in investigation for harbouring a Falun Gong practitioner”. The applicant consulted a migration agent, who told him his situation was “not in the scope for protection”.  He applied for a Protection visa, however, after he heard his friend had been granted a Protection visa.  Tribunal’s decision  The Tribunal did not accept the applicant’s claims for protection were credible.  The Tribunal found that evidence the applicant gave before the Tribunal was inconsistent with the claims the applicant made in his application for a Protection visa.   The first inconsistency related to how the applicant discovered Mr G was a Falun Gong practitioner.  Before the Tribunal the applicant claimed that in August 2005 he went to Mr G’s home and “saw him sitting cross-legged on the floor” and asked if he was practising Falun Gong.  The applicant also said that he saw two other people he did not know sitting cross-legged on a mat. In his application for a Protection visa, the applicant did not mention two other persons being present when he entered Mr G’s home.  Further, the applicant did not say in his application for a Protection visa that he saw Mr G sitting cross-legged on the floor.  What the applicant said was that Mr G came out of the bedroom after the applicant entered Mr G’s home.  The Tribunal put this inconsistency to the applicant.  The applicant responded by saying his accounts “should be the same.  The second inconsistency relates to the circumstances in which the applicant claimed he sheltered Mr G.  Before the Tribunal, the applicant said Mr G telephoned him and asked him to return home.  When he arrived, at around 6 or 7 pm, Mr G begged the applicant to allow him to stay at his home for three days.  Mr G did not at the beginning tell the applicant why he wanted to stay at the applicant’s house.  The applicant said he did not ask Mr G why he wanted to stay.  The applicant said that the police were searching for Mr G and he knew that fact, even though he had no conversations with Mr G about it because the applicant knew Mr G was a Falun Gong practitioner.  The applicant said he asked Mr G to leave.  This account is different from the account the applicant gave in his application for a Protection visa.  In that application, the applicant said Mr G informed the applicant why he wanted to be sheltered, namely, that he and two other practitioners had encountered the Joint Defence Force while putting Falun Gong-related leaflets into mailboxes. The Tribunal relied on other matters for not accepting the applicant’s claims to be credible:  The applicant had left China with no difficulty.  He renewed his passport in Sydney and the passport was issued on 1 March 2013, after he had applied for a Protection visa.  Relying on country information, the Tribunal found that these facts were inconsistent with the Chinese authorities having any interest in the applicant. The applicant’s delay in applying for a Protection visa.  The applicant arrived in Australia in April 2009, yet he did not apply for protection until 29 November 2012.  The Tribunal did not accept the applicant’s explanation for his delay. The Tribunal found inconsistent the applicant’s evidence that he worked in Korea for three years from 2005 to 2007 and returned to China in 2007 with his being in China in August 2005, being the month in which the applicant claimed he was told Mr G practised or witnessed Mr G practising Falun Gong in Mr G’s home.  The Tribunal, therefore, did not accept the applicant had discovered Mr G was a Falun Gong practitioner;  that the applicant had hidden Mr G in his home; that the applicant was arrested, detained and beaten by police; that police searched the applicant’s home;  that, after arriving in Australia, police again searched the applicant’s home in China and detained the applicant’s wife, who divulged his involvement in hiding Mr G;  that the police or any authority in China had any interest in the applicant because he sheltered a Falun Gong practitioner;  or that the applicant is an actual or imputed supporter of Falun Gong or will be in the future if he returns to China. Grounds of application   I now turn to the grounds of review stated in the grounds of application.  There are three.  The first is:  The Tribunal did not exactly following 36(2)(aa) of the Act. As a non-practising supporter of Falun Gong, I will face significant harm if returning to China. The Tribunal wrongly undervalued the evidence I got adverse attention of authorities in China in the past and that my wife had been subject to police questioning after I left China.  This ground does not disclose any jurisdictional error.  It does no more than manifest disagreement with the Tribunal’s conclusion that it did not accept the applicant’s claim for protection to be credible.  It was reasonably open to the Tribunal to conclude the applicant’s claims were not credible for the reasons the Tribunal gave.  Ground 1 therefore fails.  The second ground of application is:  When assessing the credibility of my claims, although the Refugee Review Tribunal (the Tribunal) is not required to accept uncritically any or all of the claims made in my applicant, the benefit of the doubt should be given as I am generally credible but unable to substantiate all of my claims. The Tribunal ignored my evidence and wrongly concluded that I had not attracted the adverse attention of the Chinese authorities. This ground makes a number of distinct claims.  The first is that there was some doubt in the applicant’s evidence, and that such doubt should have been resolved in the applicant’s favour.  There is no such principle or, if there is, a breach of such a principle does not necessarily lead to the  Tribunal making a jurisdictional error.  In any event, it was reasonably open to the Tribunal to consider the doubts it had about the credibility of the applicant’s claims were sufficiently substantial to lead it not to accept the applicant’s claims were credible.  The second claim made in the second ground is the assertion that the applicant was credible but was unable to substantiate his claims.  There is no merit in that claim.  It was for the Tribunal to assess the applicant’s credibility, and it was reasonably open to the  Tribunal for the reasons it gave for not accepting the applicant’s claims as being credible.  The third claim made in the second ground is that the Tribunal ignored the applicant’s evidence.  That claim also has no merit.  The Tribunal considered the applicant’s evidence.  It considered the applicant’s evidence, but did not accept it.  For these reasons, ground 2 fails. The third ground stated in the application is: The Refugee Review Tribunal (RRT) unfairly ignored my well-founded fear of persecution in China. I am a Falun Gong practitioner. The campaign initiated by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) against practitioners of Falun Gong since July 1999, aimed at eliminating the practice in China. According to Amnesty International, it includes a multifaceted propaganda campaign, a program of enforced ideological conversion and re-education, and a variety of extralegal coercive measures such as arbitrary arrests, forced labor, and physical torture sometimes resulting in death. Thus, this religion reason of fear set out in the Refugees Convention should have been considered by the RRT. This ground assumes the applicant claimed before the Tribunal that he was a Falun Gong practitioner.  The applicant made no such claim.  The applicant claimed he feared persecution because he harboured a Falun Gong practitioner.  The basis of his claim was that he would be imputed with being a Falun Gong practitioner or supporter.  The Tribunal considered that claim and rejected it.   Further, there is no substance to this ground to the extent it claims the Tribunal ignored the applicant’s claims for having a well-founded fear of persecution in China.  As my recitation of the Tribunal’s reasons indicates, the Tribunal did consider the applicant’s claims.  What it did was consider them, but unfortunately for the applicant, reject them.  For these reasons, ground 3 therefore also fails.   Given my conclusions, it follows that the application must be dismissed. I invited submissions as to the question of costs.  The Minister applies for costs, seeking the amount of $6,646.  The applicant opposes any such order on the ground that he lacks the financial capacity to meet such costs order.  That is not a reason for the Court not to exercise its discretion to order costs against the applicant who has failed in the proceedings.  As I informed the applicant, any issue in relation to his ability to pay those costs is a matter that he will need to discuss with the Minister’s lawyers in the event or to the extent to which the minister seeks to take any action to enforce the costs orders.   For those reasons, I also propose that the applicant pay the minister’s costs seeking the amount of $6,646.I certify that the preceding twenty-four (24) paragraphs are a true copy of the reasons for judgment of Judge ManousaridisAssociate:  Date:  27 October 2015       ',\n",
       " 'SZVHS v Minister for Immigration & Anor [2015] FCCA 2927 (29 October 2015)': \"  This is an application for a Constitutional writ within the Court’s jurisdiction under s.476 of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) in respect of a decision of the Tribunal made on 23 September 2014 affirming a decision of the delegate not to grant the applicant a Protection (Class 6A) visa.  The applicant was found to be a citizen of the People’s Republic of China. The applicant’s claims for protection were assessed as against that country, being the country of nationality, and in relation to the applicant’s claims in respect of complementary protection, that country was treated as the receiving country. The applicant obtained a passport issued by the People’s Republic of China on 16 February 2007 and arrived in Australia on a Subclass 456 visa on 27 May 2008 and departed Australia on 5 June 2008.  On 5 September 2008 the applicant arrived in Australia on a Subclass 456 visa which expired on 5 October 2008.  The applicant then became an unlawful person in Australia and did not make an application for protection until 13 October 2013.  On 25 November 2015 the Court made orders providing the applicant an opportunity to amend his application, put on affidavit evidence and provide submissions.  No such documents were filed. Those orders also listed the matter for hearing today as a show cause hearing under r.44.12 of the Federal Circuit Court Rules 2001.  The application identifies the following grounds:   1. The decision of the Tribunal:  a) was affected by procedural unfairness.  b) failed to take into account relevant considerations. The delegate refused to grant the applicant a visa on 4 March 2014.  The delegate found that the applicant’s claims in relation to being of adverse interest to the Chinese authorities were not credible and that the applicant’s claims in relation to business competitors and money lenders were not credible. On 11 August 2014 the applicant was sent a letter inviting the applicant to attend a hearing on 16 September 2014.  At the request of the applicant’s legal representative that hearing was postponed to 23 September 2014.   Contrary to what was put by the applicant as to there being no registered migration agent present, the record of hearing records the presence of the applicant’s identified migration agent as specified in the application for review under the heading “Representative details”.  The applicant attended the hearing on 23 September to give evidence and present arguments and was assisted by the interpreter.  The applicant claimed to fear persecution relevantly as follows: He was a successful textile businessman in his area. He was also a generous person and made donations to the temple and other religious organizations including a house church. Rivals informed the Chinese authorities that he was an active member of a house church. The police searched his premises for evidence. His rivals, who have connections with the authorities and the police, have stalked him and collected relevant evidence against him. The authorities investigated his business operations and the information they obtained was passed on to his rivals. As a result his business plummeted and was close to closing down. He had no ability to repay his creditors. His creditors have gone to his house, taken his valuables without issuing a receipt and have threatened to have him killed if their money is not re-paid. They have warned him that they can pay money to the police to have him gaoled if they wished to do so. The authorities have accused him of being a member of a house church. The Chinese authorities and business operators collude for commercial interests. The authorities have helped his rivals to achieve business success at his expense and will not protect him if he returns to China.  He has been intimidated, threatened and stalked by the Chinese authorities and unknown people. He left China to escape persecution and punishment from the Chinese authorities as well as his competitors and private creditors. He fears being persecuted and gaoled by the Chinese authorities, harmed by other competitors and mistreated by private creditors. He fears for the safety of his life. The Tribunal found the applicant was not a credible witness and that he was fabricating evidence.  The Tribunal also put to the applicant that in obtaining his business visa he had provided false information suggesting he was a sales manager of a particular company.  The applicant acknowledged that he was never employed as a sales manager of that company and that the documents provided were fake documents to obtain a visa.  It is clear that the Tribunal put that matter to the applicant in accordance with s.424AA as identified in paras.30 and 31.  The Tribunal found, relevantly:  32. Having considered all the evidence, individually and cumulatively, the Tribunal is of the view that the applicant is not a witness of truth and that he fabricated his claims for the purpose of obtaining a Protection visa. The Tribunal finds that the applicant is not a credible witness and was prepared to say anything to obtain a Protection visa without any regard for the truth. The Tribunal does not accept that the application donated money to a temple, a house church, a Buddhist gathering or any other religious organization in China. It follows that the Tribunal does not accept that the applicant's business competitors/rivals or alternatively Mr Jian Yang informed the Chinese authorities that he was an active member of a house church, a Buddhist gathering or any other religious organization. The Tribunal does not accept that the Chinese authorities have accused the applicant of being a member of a house church or alternatively a Buddhist gathering. The Tribunal does not accept that the applicant's business competitors/rivals or alternatively Mr Jian Yang have [stalked him and collected relevant evidence against him. ·  33. The Tribunal does not accept that the police searched the applicant's premises for evidence, investigated his business operations and passed on information about his business to his business competitors/rivals or alternatively Mr Jian Yang and his business plummeted as a result. The Tribunal does not accept that the Chinese authorities helped the applicant's business competitors/rivals or alternatively Mr Jian Yang to achieve business success at his expense. The Tribunal does not accept that the applicant has been intimidated, threatened arid stalked by the Chinese authorities.  34. The Tribunal does not accept that Mr Jian Yang told the applicant's bank not to lend him any money and to refer him to a money lender who was Mr Jian Yang's friend. The Tribunal does not accept that the bank acted on Mr Jian Yang's instructions. The Tribunal does not accept that the bank colluded with Mr Jian Yang to set a trap for the applicant. The Tribunal does not accept that the applicant or his wife reported Mr Jian Yang to the police or to a “higher level of government agency”. Alternatively, the Tribunal does not accept that the applicant did not report his business competitors/rivals or alternatively Mr Jian Yang to the police because they have a broad network and have connections with the police.  35. The Tribunal does not accept that the applicant borrowed money from private creditors or alternatively a money lender because he was unable to repay a bank loan. It follows that the Tribunal does not accept that the private creditors or alternatively the money lender or his thugs went to his home, smashed things and threw things around. The Tribunal does not accept that the private creditors or alternatively the money lender or his thugs took valuables from the applicant's house without issuing a receipt. The Tribunal does not accept that the applicant repaid a loan from the private creditors or alternatively the money lender, did not obtain a receipt for the repayment and the private creditors or alternatively the money lender or his thugs use the loan agreement to try and extort more money from him.  36. The Tribunal does not accept that the money lender or his thugs went to the applicant's house every 2 to 3 days or every 6 months making inquiries about his whereabouts and threatening to kill him and/or his family members. The Tribunal does not accept that the money lender or his thugs threatened the applicant that they would pay money to the police and have him gaoled. The Tribunal does not accept that the applicant's wife reported the money lender or his thugs to the police and the police went to his house and took them away. Alternatively, the Tribunal does not accept that the applicant did not report his private creditors or the money lender or his thugs to the police because they have a broad network and have connections with the police.  37. The Tribunal does not accept that the applicant's fears commenced in 2004 and became more intense in 2008. The Tribunal does not accept that the applicant has been intimidated, threatened and stalked by unknown people.  38. The Tribunal does not accept that the Chinese authorities will not protect the applicant, should he need protection, when he returns to China. The Tribunal does not accept that the applicant fears persecution and being sent to gaol by the Chinese authorities, fears harm from his business competitors/rivals or alternatively Mr Jian Yang and fears mistreatment by private creditors or alternatively the money lender or his thugs. The Tribunal does not accept that the applicant fears for his life if he returns to China now or in the foreseeable future.  39. The Tribunal accepts that the applicant owned a textile business in China and that the business was not doing very well. The Tribunal accepts that the applicant borrowed money from a bank for his textile business and has repaid the money in full. The Tribunal accepts that the applicant came to Australia in May 2008 to make inquiries in relation to business opportunities in Australia.  40. Having considered all of the applicant's claims, individually and cumulatively, the Tribunal finds that there is no real chance that he would be at risk of persecution on the grounds of actual or imputed religion, membership of a particular social group or any other Convention reason if he returns to China now or in the reasonably foreseeable future. The Tribunal finds that the applicant does not have a well-founded fear of persecution for a Convention reason. Therefore, the Tribunal finds that the applicant does not satisfy the criterion in s.36(2)(a). In relation to the consideration of complementary protection, the Tribunal noted that it had rejected the entirety of the applicant’s claims and had formed the view that the applicant’s claims were fabricated. It was in those circumstances that the Tribunal found there were no substantial grounds for believing that as a necessary and reasonable consequence of being removed from Australia to China there is a real risk that the applicant would suffer harm.  The Tribunal found the applicant was not a person in respect of whom Australia had protection obligation and that the criteria under ss.36(2)(a) and 36(2)(aa) of the Act were not satisfied.   I accept the first respondent’s submission that the bare allegations identified in the application fail to identify any arguable case of jurisdictional error.  I accept the first respondent’s submission that there is no evidence that the Tribunal failed to comply with s.425 of the Act or any of its procedural fairness obligations set out in Division 4 of Pt.7 of the Act.  I accept the first respondent’s submission in relation to the applicant obtaining the business visa using fake documents that this was put to the applicant in compliance with and pursuant to s.424AA of the Act.   Accordingly, there is no arguable case identified of the review being affected by procedural unfairness. No alleged relevant consideration was identified that the Tribunal failed to take into account. I accept the first respondent’s submission that the application does not raise an arguable case for the relief sought.   The applicant maintained that he had been truthful to the Tribunal and that if he returned to China there was a loan shark who would kill him.  The applicant’s credit was a matter for the Tribunal to determine and the adverse findings by the Tribunal in respect of the applicant’s credit were clearly open on the material before the Tribunal.  The applicant’s fears in relation to the loan shark were the subject of adverse findings by the Tribunal.   The applicant maintained that his registered migration agent was not present at the hearing.  Whilst this is not consistent with the record of the hearing by the Tribunal, there is nothing to indicate that the absence of the registered migration agent gave rise to any procedural unfairness.  The applicant asserted from the bar table that the interpreter was not good enough and that he got the reference to the loan shark wrong.  There is no evidence to support the applicant’s contentions from the bar table.  No affidavit has been filed to suggest any difficulty with the interpreter.  No transcript has been put on by the applicant. This was an applicant who had admitted making fake documents and remained in Australia unlawfully. There is nothing in the reasons of the Tribunal to suggest any difficulty by the applicant with the interpreter, nor does the generalised reference to getting the loan shark issue wrong identify any arguable issue of a denial of procedural fairness in relation to the interpreter. It is clear that the claims identified by the delegate included threats in relation to money lenders as well as being addressed in the applicant’s record of interview on 24 February 2014 and that that same issue was identified as one of the applicant’s claims by the Tribunal.  The Tribunal found the applicant was not a witness of truth and was fabricating his claims for the purpose of obtaining a protection visa.  I do not accept that there is any basis from what was said by the applicant to identify any real issue of difficulty with the interpreter. I find the application fails to identify an arguable case for the relief sought and that this is an appropriate case for the Court to exercise its power under r.44.12(1)(a) of the Federal Circuit Court Rules 2001 to dismiss the application.  The application is dismissed under r.44.12 of the Federal Circuit Court Rules 2001.I certify that the preceding fourteen (14) paragraphs are a true copy of the reasons for judgment of Judge StreetAssociate:  Date:  2 November 2015       \",\n",
       " 'SZVIT v Minister for Immigration & Anor [2015] FCCA 3022 (10 November 2015)': \" (revised from transcript)  I have before me an application seeking judicial review of a decision of the former Refugee Review Tribunal, now the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (Tribunal), made on 22 September 2014.  The Tribunal affirmed a decision of the delegate of the Minister not to grant the applicant a protection visa.  The applicant is from China and had made claims for protection based upon his asserted practice of Falun Gong.  Background facts relating to those claims and the Tribunal decision on them are set out in the Minister’s outline of written submissions filed on 3 November 2015.   The applicant is a male citizen of China born on 29 February 1980. He arrived in Australia on 11 August 2013.  The applicant applied for a protection (Class XA) visa on 4 November 2013.[1] The application was refused by a delegate of the Minister on 11 February 2014.[2] The applicant applied to the Tribunal for review of the delegate's decision on 19 March 2014.[3]  The applicant gave oral evidence before the Tribunal on 15 September 2014. The Tribunal made its decision on 22 September 2014.[4] The applicant set out claims in his protection visa application form and in a statement submitted to the Tribunal. In summary the applicant claimed that: he began practising Falun Gong in 1996 while he was at school, but he stopped practising in 1999 when it was banned at his school; he did not practice again until 2007; he resumed his practice of Falun Gong in 2007 after having sustained an injury. He would practise in private, however a co-worker saw him practising one day and shortly after he was approached by security guards; the applicant was detained in January 2008 for ten months, and during his detention he was tortured and humiliated; in September 2010 he was detained for another month and he was also detained in September 2012 for one month; and he got his passport in June 2013 and left China, but he had to pay two bribes; The decision of the Tribunal  The Tribunal accepted that country information indicated that the Chinese government had banned Falun Gong as an illegal cult and that practitioners were still detained and subjected to serious mistreatment in China.[5] However the Tribunal found that the applicant was not a credible witness and rejected his claims in their entirety. The reasons the Tribunal found the applicant was not a credible witness in summary were: the Tribunal was concerned that the applicant's evidence at the hearing about his early involvement in Falun Gong activity was vague and, in important respects inconsistent with his written claims;[6] the Tribunal found the applicant's evidence about when he ceased practising Falun Gong vague and unconvincing;[7] the Tribunal acknowledged that the applicant's evidence about the three occasions on which he was detained in China was broadly consistent with his written claims, however it was concerned that his evidence about his claimed detention in China was vague and shifted over the course of the hearing;[8] The Tribunal found that the applicant’s knowledge of Falun Gong was inconsistent with his claim to have practised Falun Gong in China. As was put to the applicant, the Tribunal found it difficult to accept that the applicant practised Falun Gong in school from 1997 and continuously for ten to twenty days in 2008 and yet was unable to name any of the Falun Gong exercises and only performed one exercise.[9] The Tribunal found unconvincing and not credible the applicant’s evidence that he has not practised Falun Gong in Australia because he needed to obtain protection from the Australian Government but he will practice once he acquires “legal” status.[10] The Tribunal did not accept the applicant’s reasons for failing to attend the interview with the delegate.[11] The Tribunal considered the fact that the applicant was able to travel out of China on a valid passport issued in his own name suggested that he was not, at that time, of adverse interest to the Chinese authorities for any reason.[12] The Tribunal found that the applicant's evidence that he was persecuted because of his involvement in Falun Gong activity in China was not credible and that his claims regarding detention were not otherwise credible by reference to corroborating documentation.[13] The Tribunal rejected all of the applicant's claims and found that the applicant was never a Falun Gong practitioner.[14] The Tribunal found that the applicant fabricated his claims in their entirety and on the evidence before it the Tribunal was not satisfied that the applicant would face serious harm for the purposes of the Refugee Convention, either now or in the reasonably foreseeable future if he returned to China.[15] On the basis of the Tribunal’s wholesale rejection of the applicant's claims, the Tribunal found that the applicant also did not satisfy the criteria for complementary protection.[16] The present proceedings  These proceedings began with a show cause application filed on 24 October 2014.  The applicant has not taken up the opportunity I afforded him to file an amended application.  The applicant is unrepresented. His application contains three grounds:  1.  The Refugee Review Tribunal is affected by jurisdictional error in that it did not comply with its obligation to put adverse information to the applicant to comment in accordance with the Migration Act 1958.  2.  The Tribunal breached the rules of natural justice in connection with the making of the decision.  3.  The Tribunal failed to consider the Chinese government persecute all Falun Gong Practitioners even their knowledge of Falun Gong is limited. The applicant attended a directions hearing on 27 November 2014 with the assistance of a Mandarin interpreter.   At that time, I made orders to prepare the matter for a show cause hearing today.  I am satisfied that the applicant understood that the matter would be heard on an interim basis today.  There was no appearance by or on behalf of the applicant when the matter was called today.  The matter has been called twice and on each occasion there was no answer to the call.   Before I came on the bench, an attempt was made to contact the applicant on his nominated mobile telephone number with the assistance of the interpreter.  That attempt was unsuccessful.  The phone had been turned off.   I received into evidence the affidavit of Rachael Nadine Fresta made on 9 September 2015.  Ms Fresta is employed in the office of the Minister’s solicitors.  Annexure A to her affidavit is a letter dated 3 November 2015 to the applicant at his residential and postal addresses reminding him of the Court fixture today and warning him that a failure to attend may result in the matter being dismissed with costs.  Annexure B to the affidavit is a courier receipt indicating that the correspondence was left under the door at the residential address.   There being no attendance by or on behalf of the applicant today, and there being no explanation for that non-attendance, the Court being unable to contact the applicant by telephone and in light of Ms Fresta’s affidavit, I have concluded that the appropriate course is to dismiss the application on account of the applicant’s non-attendance and I will so order.   In consequence of the dismissal of the application, the Minister seeks an order for costs in accordance with the Court scale.   I will order that the applicant is to pay the first respondent’s costs and disbursements of and incidental to the application in the sum of $3,416 in accordance with rule 44.15(1) and item 2 of Division 1 of Part 3 to the Federal Circuit Court Rules 2001 (Cth). I will direct that the Minister is to arrange to have these orders entered and the Minister is to cause a sealed copy of these orders to be served on the applicant by ordinary pre-paid post at his nominated address for service, together with a copy of rule 16.05 of the Federal Circuit Court Rules 2001 (Cth).I certify that the preceding twenty-six (26) paragraphs are a true copy of the reasons for judgment of Judge DriverAssociate:  Date:  11 November 2015 [1] Court Book (CB) 1[2] CB 51[3] CB 58[4] CB 111[5] CB 118 at  [24][6] CB 118 – 119 at [25] - [27][7] CB 119 at  [28][8] CB 119 at [29][9] CB 119 – 121 at [30] - [33][10] CB 121 at [34][11] CB 121 – 122 at  [35] - [37][12] CB 122 – 123 at [38] - [39][13] CB 123 at [40][14] CB 123 – 124 at [41][15] CB 124 at [42][16] CB 124 at [43]       \",\n",
       " 'SZVWO & Anor v Minister for Immigration & Border Protection & Anor [2015] FCCA 1729 (23 June 2015)': \"  On 19 December 2014, the first applicant filed an application seeking judicial review of a decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal dated 27 November 2014 and handed down on 28 November 2014 (“the RRT”). The first and second named applicants are a married couple. The second applicant was included as a member of the first applicant’s family unit. As such, the second applicant’s claims are wholly dependent on those of the first applicant (“the Applicant”) On 19 March 2015, the Applicant attended a directions hearing before a Registrar of the Court. The Applicant confirmed she wished to continue with her application for judicial review of the RRT’s decision.  The Applicant was given leave to file and serve an amended application giving complete particulars of each ground of review relied upon, together with any further evidence by way of affidavit by 16 June 2015. The Applicant was also directed to file and serve written submissions in support of the grounds of her application by 16 June 2015. At the directions hearing, the Applicant was provided with the contact details of legal services providers and interpreting and translation services in documents headed in her own language. The matter was listed for today for a hearing pursuant to r.44.12 of the Federal Circuit Court Rules 2001 (Cth) (“the Rules”), a copy of which was also given to the Applicant, together with a copy of the costs schedule. Rule 44.12 of the Rules provides as follows:  “(1)  At a hearing of an application for an order to show cause, the Court may:  (a)  if it is not satisfied that the application has raised an arguable case for the relief claimed—dismiss the application; or  (b)  if it is satisfied that the application has raised an arguable case for the relief claimed—adjourn the proceeding and order a respondent to show cause at a final hearing why an order for the relief claimed should not be made on such of the grounds mentioned in the application as are specified by the Court; or  (c)  without making an order under paragraph (b), make final orders in relation to the claims for relief and grounds mentioned in the application.  (2)  To avoid doubt, a dismissal under paragraph (1)(a) is interlocutory.”  Relevantly, r.44.13 provides:  “(1)  At a hearing of an application for an order to show cause, the applicant is confined to the relief sought and the grounds mentioned in the application.” The Applicant was unrepresented before the Court this morning, although had the assistance of an Indonesian interpreter.  The Applicant confirmed to the Court this morning that she had not filed any further documents, either in accordance with my directions or otherwise.   The Applicant confirmed that she relied on the grounds contained in her initiating application for judicial review, filed on 19 December 2014. Those grounds are as follows:  “1. The Refugee Review Tribunal committed jurisdictional error by failing to deal with an integer of the applicant’s claims.  2. In making the decision, the Tribunal applied the wrong test.  3. The Tribunal failed to consider my claim.” In support of the grounds of her application, the Applicant said essentially that her case was true and that she did not want to return to Indonesia because her parents do not approve of her marriage. None of the grounds were supported by oral or written particulars or any relevant submission.  The first respondent, in written submissions, summarised the background of the Applicants’ claims and the RRT’s decision, as follows:  “B FACTUAL BACKGROUND  The applicants are citizens of Indonesia who arrived in Australia on 18 April 2010 as holders of student visas. They were married in Australia on 5 June 2011. The first applicant returned to Indonesia briefly on two occasions. On 2 August 2013 the first applicant lodged an application for a protection visa.[1] The second applicant was included on the application as a member of the first applicant's family unit.[2]  The first applicant claimed to fear harm in Indonesia from her father, who did not approve of her relationship with the second applicant because the second applicant's grandfather was a Muslim Indonesian (the first applicant being an ethnic Chinese of the Catholic faith).[3] She claimed that her father had threatened to kill her if she returned to Indonesia and did not divorce her husband.  The first applicant attended a Departmental interview on 21 January 2013. On 5 February 2014 a delegate of the Minister for Immigration and Border Protection refused to grant the applicants protection visas.[4] The delegate was not satisfied that the first applicant genuinely feared harm in Indonesia.   The applicants sought review of the delegate's decision before the Tribunal by application dated 12 March 2014.[5] The applicants attended a hearing before the Tribunal on 18 September 2014.[6] On 27 November 2014 the Tribunal affirmed the decision not to grant the applicants protection visas.[7]  The Tribunal's decision  The Tribunal accepted that the first applicant is an ethnic Chinese Christian, that the applicants had married in Australia, and that the marriage was not entered into for the sole purpose of strengthening their refugee claims.[8] The Tribunal also accepted that the first applicant's father disapproved of her relationship with the second applicant, and now disapproves of their marriage.   However, because their home region has a high mixed Chinese/Indonesian population, and the second applicant's Identification Certificate states his religion to be Buddhist, the Tribunal had reservations that the first applicant's father's disapproval was because the second applicant's grandfather was Muslim. The Tribunal also did not accept that the first applicant's father continues to suffer from trauma from the 1998 riots in Jakarta (which might explain his anti-Muslim opinions).[9]  Even accepting that the father did not approve of the marriage because the second applicant had a Muslim grandfather, the Tribunal was not satisfied that the first applicant suffered serious harm in the past on this basis (as the past instances of claimed harm did not rise to the level of 'serious harm').[10] The Tribunal did not accept that there is a real chance that the first applicant would suffer harm at the hands of her father were she to return to Indonesia.   The Tribunal considered the availability of state protection in Indonesia and found that the Indonesian government was willing and able to provide adequate protection to women in the first applicant's situation who feared harm from their fathers.[11]  Further, the Tribunal was satisfied that the first applicant's fear of harm was localised, and there was no real chance that the first applicant's father would pursue her all over Indonesia. The Tribunal found that the applicants could practically and reasonably relocate to another part of Indonesia, such as Jakarta.[12]  The Tribunal found that the first applicant did not satisfy either the refugee criterion or the complementary protection criterion, and noted that the second applicant did not advance his own claims for protection.” The RRT’s decision record makes clear that the RRT explored the Applicant’s claims with her at a hearing and put to her various concerns that it had about her evidence and noted the Applicant’s responses.  Ultimately, the RRT concluded that the Applicant did not have a genuine fear of being seriously harmed for a Convention related reason at the time she left Indonesia and found that the Applicant left Indonesia in order to study in Australia.  The RRT was not satisfied that any past harm that the Applicant may have suffered in Indonesia at the hands of her father amounts to serious harm, and for that reason was not satisfied that the Applicant met the refugee criteria under s.36(2)(a) or s.(2)(aa) of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) (“the Act”). The RRT was further satisfied that state protection was available to the Applicant in Indonesia and that the applicants could practically and reasonably relocate to another part of Indonesia.  There is nothing to suggest that the RRT’s findings and conclusions were not open to it on the material and evidence before it and for the reasons it gave. The Applicant has not identified, nor is there anything in the RRT’s decision record, to suggest that the RRT did not consider any integer of the Applicant’s claims. The Applicant has not identified either the test that the RRT applied that she says was wrong or what the correct test should have been.  The RRT’s decision record makes clear that the RRT understood the nature of the Applicant’s claims and evidence. The RRT then made findings based on the evidence and material before it. Those findings of fact were open to the RRT on the evidence and material before it and for the reasons it gave. A fair reading of the RRT’s decision record makes clear that the RRT reached conclusions based on the findings made by it and to which it applied the correct law. The RRT identified with specificity the country information to which it had regard. To the extent that the affidavit filed by the Applicant on 19 December 2014 in support of her application for judicial review refers to an allegation that the tribunal failed to consider her application according to s.424A of the Act, no such complaint is made out on the face of the RRT’s decision record. There was no information that formed part of the RRT’s reasons for affirming the decision under review that enlivened any obligation on the RRT to give that information to the Applicant for comment pursuant to s.424A of the Act.  While I make no final decision as to whether or not the RRT’s decision is affected by jurisdictional error, the Applicant has not identified any error on the part of the RRT that is capable of establishing jurisdictional error and none is apparent on the face of the decision record. The RRT referred to the relevant law in affirming the decision under review.  In the circumstances, I am not satisfied that the application has raised an arguable case for the relief claimed. Accordingly, in the exercise of the Court’s discretion under r.44.12(1) of the Rules and on the basis that the application does not raise an arguable case, the proceeding before this Court, commenced by way of application on 19 December 2014, should be dismissed pursuant to r.44.12(1)(a) of the Rules with costs.I certify that the preceding twenty-one (21) paragraphs are a true copy of the reasons for judgment of Judge Emmett Associate: Date: 7 July 2015 [1] Court Book (CB) 1[2] CB 16[3] CB 37-38[4] CB 90-102[5] CB 104-109[6] CB 130-132[7] CB 149-162[8] CB 152-153 at [24]-[25][9] CB 153 at [26][10] CB 153 at [27][11] CB 153 at [30][12] CB 154 at [34]       \",\n",

Background  Before the Court in evidence is the bundle of relevant documents filed by the Minister (“the Court Book” - “CB”). The applicants are wife and husband and are citizens of the People’s Republic of China (“China”). They arrived in Australia on 23 April 2009 having been granted tourist visas valid until 2 May 2009 (CB 34 to CB 35 and CB 66).  The applicants remained unlawfully in Australia until 23 January 2012 when the applicant lodged a protection visa application, which identified her husband as a member of her family unit (CB 1 to CB 32). The applicants were assisted by a person who was then a registered migration agent.   Included with the application was a “personal statement” made by the applicant (CB 38 to CB 40). She claimed that she and her husband had developed and owned a rice wine business in Jiangsu Province, China (CB 38 to CB 40).  The applicant asserted that due to “the government’s persecution” the applicants “lost the winery” and were forced “to escape from China and come to Australia” (CB 38).  The applicant claimed that due to the success of the business, the “town government wanted to merge our factory to be Town owned enterprise” (CB 38). The applicant described the conduct of town officials who, on the premise of facilitating a takeover of the business, accused and fined, the applicant “RMB $60,000” for tax evasion.  The applicant claimed that following the fine “the secretary ... and the head of town ... came up with the new idea and told us they wanted to redesign the land and we had to relocate our winery”, and on 4 June 2008 “the government gave... notice to stop our winery within a month or the government would order relevant departments to take over winery by force” (CB 38). The applicant claimed that in response to the decision she sought to appeal to the Nantong City People’s government, and was subsequently accused of “spreading propaganda against the local government” and threated with imprisonment (CB 39). She claimed that on 23 July 2008 the applicants were detained and interrogated by local police and her husband beaten. The town government took control of the applicants’ business without payment of compensation. The applicants sought appeal. The applicant also claims that both she, and her husband, had actively voiced their opposition to the government and claimed to have signed, in December 2008, the “Charter 08”, an online petition regarding human rights and democratic reforms in China. The applicant claimed that the local authorities were aware of their involvement and on 25 December 2008, while again seeking appeal, the applicants were informed by a neighbour that the police had sealed off their house. Subsequently, the applicants were fearful of being detained and made arrangements to depart China. Following arrival in Australia on 23 April 2009, the applicant contacted her parents who informed her that there were criminal charges against the applicant and her husband and they were now wanted by the authorities.  The applicant further asserts that until the application of 23 January 2012, she was unaware of the existence of protection visas, hence the delay in application.  The applicant attended an interview on 10 May 2012 (CB 69). On 23 November 2012, the delegate refused to grant the applicants protection visas on the basis that the applicant was not a person to whom Australia has protection obligations pursuant to s.36 of the Act and cl.866.221 of Schedule 2 of the Migration Regulations 1994 (Cth) (“the Regulations”) (CB 61 to CB 80).  The applicants applied to the Tribunal for review of the delegate’s decision on 24 December 2012 (CB 81 to CB 85). They were assisted by a registered migration agent (CB 93).  The Tribunal  The applicant attended a hearing before the Tribunal on 31 October 2013 (CB 99). I note that the Tribunal’s letter of 26 August 2013 invited both applicants to attend, however, on the day of the hearing only the applicant attended (CB 94 to CB 96). The Tribunal affirmed the delegate’s decision on 30 January 2014 not to grant the applicants a protection visa (CB 115).  The Tribunal noted in its decision record that it “did not find the applicant to be a credible witness” ([14] at CB 121). In “considering the various internal inconsistencies”, along with the “evasive, implausible and changing evidence”, the Tribunal identified ten primary focus points of the applicant’s evidence ([15] at CB 121, [19] at CB 122, [22] at CB 123, [25] at CB 123, [27] at CB 123, [31] at CB 125, [32] at CB 125, [34] at CB 126, [36] at CB 127 and [37] at CB 127 and CB 130):“[15] Firstly, the applicant gave evidence about the guarantor of the loan (used to build the factory) which was inconsistent with the loan documents; she then changed her evidence; and then provided implausible evidence about the guarantor...   [19] Secondly, the Tribunal was concerned about the applicant’s omission to mention at hearing that she was in hiding, when telling the Tribunal where she lived...  [22] Thirdly, the Tribunal was concerned about the applicant’s differing evidence concerning whether there are outstanding charges against her...  [25] Fourthly, the Tribunal was concerned about the applicant’s differing evidence between her statement and the Notice to Halt Business Production that she produced to the Department...[27] Fifthly, the Tribunal was concerned about the applicant’s evidence concerning her name being placed on the Charter 08 blacklist and that she was subject to police interrogation on this basis, and also in light of the available country information...   [31] Sixthly, the Tribunal was concerned about the applicant’s limited knowledge of Charter 08...  [32] Seventhly, the Tribunal was concerned with the applicant’s claim that despite being on a blacklist, she was able to both obtain a passport, and to leave China illegally...  [34] Eighthly, the Tribunal was concerned that the applicant made a claim at hearing, that she had not made in her statement, about additional police visits... [36] Ninthly, the Tribunal was also concerned that since the Applicant has come to Australia she has taken no steps to remedy the injustice and the significant loss of their investments... [37] Tenthly, the Tribunal was also concerned about the applicant’s delay in lodging her protection visa application. According to the statement, the applicants left with a tour group for their own safety; according to the stamps in their passports, the applicants came to Australia on 23 April 2009; yet the applicant said she signed her protection visa application only at the end of January 2012, almost three years later...”  The Tribunal, citing the ten points above, made an adverse credibility finding against the applicant ([38] at CB 128).  Supplementary documentation was also provided by the applicant, in support of her claim, including “a land lease contract, a taxation administrative penalty decision letter, a certificate for health and hygiene, a Bank of China loan guarantee contract, Hainan Country Hospital discharge report ... and Notice to Halt Business Production, Enterprise Legal Person Business License” ([39] at CB 128).  The Tribunal considered the documentary evidence and noted that it was “generally consistent” with the applicant’s written claims ([40] at CB 128). The Tribunal did, however, put to the applicant the “significant concern” it had about the genuine nature of the “Bank of China” loan documentation and the “Notice of Halt Business Production”, noting the conflicting evidence given by the applicant at the hearing ([40] at CB 128). Following consideration of the available country information, indicating that fraudulent documents are widely available in China, and in light of the adverse credibility findings, the Tribunal did “not accept that the documentation produced by the applicant... [was] genuine” ([40] at CB 128). On the basis of the adverse credibility finding, the Tribunal rejected the applicant’s claims that ([43] at CB 129):  “...she and her husband owned a business which was adversely affected by government and police corruption or actions including being served with notices or forced to pay fines; that they petitioned any governmental department in relation to the business; that they supported and have supported Western-style democracy and values; that they held any political views adverse to any Chinese authorities (and which they discussed with others); that they signed Charter 08 and suffer consequences for this reason; that they have been imputed with an anti-government opinion by anyone in China; that the authorities have been interested in their whereabouts since they have been in Australia, or searched for them or threatened them...” Furthermore, the Tribunal did “not accept that the applicant will hold or promote anti-government or pro-human rights views in the future” ([43] at CB 129).  Ultimately, the Tribunal was not satisfied that the applicant had a “well-founded fear of persecution by the authorities in China or other groups or persons should she return to China now or in the reasonably foreseeable future” ([46] at CB 129). The applicant was therefore not a person in respect of whom Australia had protection obligations under the Refugees Convention and did not satisfy s.36(2)(a) of the Act.  The Tribunal also considered the applicants’ claims against the alternative criterion at s.36(2)(aa) of the Act. The Tribunal was not satisfied that “there [was] a real risk that the applicant [would] be harmed in China” ([47] at CB 131) and therefore was not a person in respect of whom Australia had protection obligations under s.36(2)(aa) of the Act.  The second applicant’s application was, in the circumstances, dependent upon the applicant’s claims, given that the protection visa application of 23 January 2012 identified the second applicant as a member of the applicant’s family unit. The Tribunal noted that the applicant’s husband had been invited to attend the hearing, and had indicated he would do so ([50] at CB 130). At the hearing the applicant provided a medical certificate for her husband which stated he was unfit for “interview” “from 31 October 2013 to 31 October 2013 inclusive ([51] at CB 130). I note that that date was the exact date of the hearing before the Tribunal. The Tribunal considered this document and found that there was no disclosure of any reasons, or any diagnosis, to support a reason for the mere assertion that the applicant was unfit to attend ([51] at CB 130).  The Tribunal also noted that no request for an adjournment had been made by, or on behalf or, the second applicant ([52] at CB 130). At the hearing, the Tribunal asked the applicant why her husband had not advanced a claim as a “primary” applicant. That is, advanced claims to fear harm in his own right. The applicant asserted that, at the time of the application they were “not aware of how the forms worked” ([49] at CB 130). The Tribunal noted that while the applicants were represented, such representation was not for the initial application process, and that when the migration agent was deregistered prior to the hearing, the agent continued to assist as a “friend” of the applicants. Nonetheless, the Tribunal considered the second applicant’s claims to protection as they related to, and were advanced by, the applicant. The Tribunal considered the documentary evidence provided by the applicant concerning the second applicant at the hearing, which showed that ([51] at CB 130):  “...the second applicant had been in a car accident in July 2013; he was examined on 17 August 2013 by his GP who diagnosed that he was suffering from PTSD, poor memory and concentration and persistent headache and trauma to the head... from 5 September 2013 he was fit for alternative duties (home office duties and no driving); and as at 5 September 2013 it was estimated that from 30 October 2013 he would be fit for home duties and lifting no more than five kg...” The Tribunal considered that the second applicant had “been provided with an opportunity to present arguments and give evidence in accordance with s.425 of the Act” ([53] at CB 131).  In particular it noted that no submissions were received from the applicant after the hearing on 31 October 2013 ([52] at CB 131). Ultimately the Tribunal was not satisfied that the second applicant had a well-founded fear of persecution in China or that there were substantial grounds for believing that there was a real risk that he would suffer significant harm if returned to China. The Grounds of the Application  The application of 28 February 2014 contained the following three grounds of view:  “1. The Refugee Review Tribunal (the Tribunal) did not review my case with care and justice. Although the relevant facts of the individual case will have to be supplied by the applicant himself or herself, in as much detail is as necessary to enable the examiner to establish the relevant facts, the concept of onus of proof is not appropriate to administrative inquiries and decision-making. In this case, I gave evidence about the guarantor of the loan (used to build the factory), and explained the reason of inconsistent with the loan document. This was ignored by the Tribunal.  2. The Tribunal unfairly refused my evidence about my political activities. The Tribunal should have examined my political opinion with fairness. My name was placed on the Charter 08 blacklist and that I was subject to police interrogation on this basis. I had been placed on the blacklist by authorities in 2008 for having signed the Charter online. Also I evidenced how I knew my names was on the blacklist because the police came to interrogate me about it at that time.   3. Tribunal did not carefully consider the alternative criterion in s.36(2)(aa). There is a real chance of we being harmed if we were to return to China. We were afraid of revenge from the local authorities in China. I provided the evidence that the police had come to my parents and asked for us. We were told to return to China and report to the police voluntarily as we had criminal charges against us. The evidence showed if we return back to China within 10 years, the police would arrest us and wouldn’t release us for 10 years. The police and the village government will persecute us if we return back to China.” Consideration  Before the Court today, the applicant appeared in person.  She was assisted by an interpreter in the Mandarin language.  While the second applicant was said to be present in the precincts of the Court, the applicant confirmed that she would speak on his behalf.   The applicant’s submission to the Court today was that she felt that there were some unreasonable aspects to the department’s rejection of her claims. In context, I understood this to be a reference to the Tribunal.   The applicant then proceeded to list a number of these matters which, to a large extent, mirrored the items on which the Tribunal had based its adverse conclusion in relation to her credibility.   The applicant took issue with the Tribunal’s individual findings that were informative of its conclusion of the lack of credibility in her claims.  The applicant submitted that she could not understand why the Tribunal did not accept her explanations, and “reasons”, in relation to its concerns.  As I sought to explain to the applicant, the Tribunal is not required to uncritically accept an applicant’s explanation, nor, indeed, any aspect of an applicant’s evidence.   The issue relevant before the Court today is whether there is any legal error in what the Tribunal has done. It is trite to say that there is no legal error where the Tribunal’s findings, including its findings as to an applicant’s credibility, were reasonably open to it to make on the material that was before it, and for which it gave cogent reasons.  Before the Court today, the applicant, in effect, sought that the Court intervene and substitute its own findings of fact for those of the Tribunal.  This is a request for this Court to engage in impermissible merits review (Minister for Immigration & Ethnic Affairs v Wu Shan Liang [1996] HCA 6;  (1996) 185 CLR 259). Nothing that the applicant said to the Court today reveals any legal error on the part of the Tribunal.   What is of immediate note, in relation to all three of the grounds of the application and the material before the Court, is that only the applicant advanced claims to fear harm before the Tribunal. The applicant made a written statement which was lodged with her application.  She attended an interview with the delegate, and at a hearing before the Tribunal.   The second applicant made no written statement, did not attend the interview with the delegate, and did not attend the hearing before the Tribunal.  In this latter regard, the Tribunal exercised its discretion, pursuant to s.426A of the Act, to proceed to a decision.  The Tribunal’s decision to proceed in this fashion, in relation to the second applicant, was, in the circumstances presented to the Court, reasonable (see [21] – [23] above). The Tribunal gave an “intelligible justification” for the exercise of its discretion to proceed to a decision, without the second applicant having attended at the hearing (Minister for Immigration and Citizenship v Li [2013] HCA 18;  (2013) 249 CLR 332 (“Li”) and Minister for Immigration and Border Protection v Singh  [2014] FCAFC 1;  (2014) 308 ALR 280).  As set out above, the core reason that the Tribunal affirmed the delegate’s decision was its comprehensive finding in relation to the applicant’s credibility, which was the basis for its rejection of her factual assertions as to past harm, and to why she said she feared harm in the future.   The Tribunal’s finding, and the antecedent findings which informed it, were all reasonably open to the Tribunal on what was before it, and no jurisdictional error arises from the grounds of the application in this regard (Re Minister for Immigration & Multicultural Affairs; Ex parte Durairajasingham [2000] HCA 1;  (2000) 168 ALR 407).  I now turn to paragraph one of the application.  The words “did not review my case with care and justice” possibly seek to invoke s.420 of the Act, with some assertion that the Tribunal acted unjustly.  However, as the Minister’s submissions correctly stated, this does not assist the applicants, for the reasons as explained by French CJ in Li (see at [12]). If what is said in paragraph one of the grounds was meant as some complaint that the applicants were denied procedural fairness, such a claim is not made out on what is presented to the Court.   Both applicants were invited to a hearing before the Tribunal pursuant to s.425 of the Act.  The applicant attended and was given the opportunity to make her arguments and give her evidence.  The Tribunal raised with the applicant the issues relevant to the review.  In relation to the second applicant, what is set out above stands in answer.   The second element in paragraph one, is the assertion that the Tribunal ignored the applicant’s evidence concerning the claimed bank loan, and the guarantor for the bank loan, that was said to have been provided to them in China.  This is one of the matters that the applicant pressed before the Court today.   Any plain reading of the Tribunal’s decision record, and I refer particularly to paragraphs [16] to [18] (at CB 121 to CB 122), reveals that the applicant’s complaint is not that the Tribunal ignored her evidence, but that the Tribunal did not accept her evidence, in this regard.  The relevant findings here were reasonably open to the Tribunal to make. This is another example of the applicant seeking impermissible merits review.  In all, paragraph one of the grounds is not made out.   Paragraph two asserts that the Tribunal unfairly refused her evidence about her political activities, involving her claim to have signed the Charter ’08, which led to her being blacklisted by the Chinese authorities.   It is clear that the Tribunal considered this claim ([27] to [31] at CB 123 to CB 125).  The Tribunal rejected the truthfulness of this claim based on the applicant’s own evidence to the Tribunal and country information that was available to it.  The Tribunal’s findings here were reasonably open to it to make, and no unfairness arises simply because the Tribunal did not believe the applicant.  The Tribunal gave comprehensive reasons for not doing so. Paragraph two of the grounds is not made out.  Paragraph three asserts that the Tribunal did not carefully consider the applicant’s claims as against the complementary protection criterion.  This again must be understood in the context of the claim being that, not that the Tribunal did not consider it, but that it did not “carefully” consider that criterion.  I note from the material before the Court that the Tribunal did give consideration to this criterion in relation to both applicants.  It found that neither applicant satisfied this criterion.   In relation to the first applicant, the Tribunal relied on factual findings which it had set out earlier in its decision record. No legal error arises in circumstances where the Tribunal is entitled to rely on its earlier stated factual findings (SZSGA v Minister for Immigration, Multicultural Affairs and Citizenship [2013] FCA 774 at  [55] – [56] and SZSHK v Minister for Immigration and Border Protection [2013] FCAFC 125). The Tribunal proceeded in a similar fashion with the second applicant.  No legal error is apparent here.   Conclusion  In all, none of the “grounds” of the application to the Court reveal jurisdictional error on the part of the Tribunal.  It is appropriate in that circumstance that the application to the Court be dismissed. I certify that the preceding forty-eight (48) paragraphs are a true copy of the reasons for judgment of Judge NichollsAssociate:  Date: 6 August 2015       ',\n",
       " 'Sandu v Minister for Immigration & Anor [2015] FCCA 2243 (19 August 2015)': \"  The Applicant filed an Application for judicial review of a decision of the Migration Review Tribunal (as it then was) (‘the Tribunal’) made on 14 January 2015. In that Application filed by him on 3 February 2015, the Applicant sought an order that the decision of the Tribunal be quashed. The grounds of application, as set out by him, went to merits review of the decision of the Tribunal. No grounds of judicial review were stated.  In that regard, the substantive application of the Applicant was meaningless for the purposes of judicial review of the Tribunal decision by this Court. The Applicant would no doubt have been ordered to file an amended application when the matter proceeded before Registrar Allaway on 13 May 2015, in light of the inadequacies in his Appliction. Prior to that time, and on 16 February 2015, the First Respondent had filed a Response opposing the application for an order to show cause on the grounds that the Tribunal decision was not affected by jurisdictional error. On 13 May 2015, the Applicant’s judicial review application came before Registrar Allaway.  On that day there was no appearance by the Applicant.  The Court ordered that the Application be dismissed and that the Applicant pay the First Respondent’s costs of the proceeding fixed in the sum of $1,367. On 28 May 2015, the Applicant filed an Application in a Case. He sought no orders in that application, but it is clear from the contents of an Affidavit relied upon by him, sworn on the 27 May 2015, that the Application sought to set aside the Orders made by Registrar Allaway pursuant to sub-r.16.05(2)(a) of the Federal Circuit Court Rules 2001 (Cth) (‘the Rules’). The First Respondent opposed the proceeding being reinstated. The First Respondent relied upon the Response dated 16 February 2015 and an Affidavit of Mr Vincenzo Murano affirmed on 5 June 2015.  In addition, the First Respondent filed Written Submissions as to reinstatement of the proceedings, dated 9 June 2015. In considering this matter I note what was said by Justice Ryan in MZYEZ v Minister for Immigration & Citizenship [2010] FCA 530 at paragraph 7:-  “In circumstances where, as in the present case, a proceeding has been dismissed in a party’s absence and reinstatement is sought, a discretion falls to be exercised by the court before which the application for reinstatement is returnable.  That discretion requires the consideration of three factors, and whether, on balance, they tend for or against the reinstatement.  Those factors are:  (a) whether there was a reasonable excuse for the party’s absence from the hearing in which the proceeding was struck out;  (b) the existence and nature of any prejudice which might flow to the other party from the reinstatement, and the extent, if any, to which that prejudice can be assuaged by an adjournment, an order for costs or other relief which the court is empowered to grant;    (c) whether the applicant has a reasonably arguable prospect of success on the substantive application. As North J said in MZAKJ v Minister for Immigration and Multi-Cultural and Indigenous Affairs (2005) FCA 1066 at  [18]:  The decision whether to reinstate the appeal depends, however, not only on the existence of a reasonable explanation for the need to adjourn the appeal, but, also whether the appeal, if reinstated, has a reasonable chance of success.  If not, there is no purpose in reinstatement (emphasis added).” In essence, the First Respondent opposed reinstatement of the Applicant’s Application because he argued there was before the Court no reasonable excuse for the Applicant’s failure to appear on 13 May 2015, and because the Applicant’s substantive proceedings had no reasonably arguable prospect of success. The First Respondent conceded that reinstatement of the Applicant’s Application would occasion no prejudice to the First Respondent that could not be remedied by an appropriate order for costs.   The Court finds there is no reasonable excuse for the Applicant’s absence from the hearing before Registrar Allaway for these reasons:- on 3 February 2015, the Applicant was provided with the first return date on the Application which he filed at the Court’s registry. On 16 February 2015, Mr Murano, acting on instructions from the First Respondent, wrote to the Applicant. That letter stated, amongst other things, that the Application of the Applicant was listed for a first court date before the Federal Circuit Court on 13 May 2015 at 10am. Under the heading “Requirement to appear at Court” Mr Murano also indicated to the Applicant that it was important he appear in court each time that his matter was listed for hearing. The correspondence said further:-  “If you do not appear in Court at the date and time required, your application may be dismissed and you may be ordered to pay our client’s costs of the proceeding.”[1] Mr Murano’s correspondence also set out the Court’s telephone number for the Applicant, advised him of the noticeboard on the ground level of the Court and advised of the Court’s website details and of the Commonwealth Courts Portal details.  At the conclusion of that correspondence the letter said:-  “Please, contact Vince Murano if you have any queries.”[2]Mr Murano deposes in his Affidavit affirmed on 5 June 2015 that other than the Applicant filing his Application on 3 February 2015 and his Application in a Case on 28 May 2015, the Applicant has made no contact with Clayton Utz. The Applicant does not take issue with this.  the Applicant was given written notice of the time, date and place of the first hearing date in clear terms on at least two occasions.  His oral submissions on 10 June 2015 that he wrongly believed the matter was listed for 15 May 2015, which he altered to the 13 June 2015, and then to 15 June 2015, were not plausible, nor reasonable explanations in light of the Applicant’s knowledge of the time and place of hearing of his application by its provision to him in written form. There was no basis for his mistaken belief as to the date of hearing. His lack of due diligence in prosecuting his application, and failure to seek out confirmation of the date of hearing from the Solicitor for the First Respondent, in circumstances where he claimed to have lost his file on return from a month long trip to India, also weighed against him and were not evidence of reasonableness in his conduct nor did they go favourably as to the Applicant’s credit. the Applicant claimed he was depressed and suggested this was a reasonable excuse for his failure to attend the earlier hearing. No medical evidence was provided by the Applicant as to his claimed depression by way of any attachment to his own Affidavit, nor by way of an independent affidavit sworn by a doctor. No medical evidence was produced by him at the hearing of his Application in a Case on 10 June 2015 in support of his oral submissions. The Court in those circumstances does not accept this claim as to medical inability as the basis for his failure to attend the earlier hearing date on 13 May 2015. Lack of reasonable prospect of success  The Application before the Tribunal was to review a decision made by a Delegate of the Minister for Immigration & Border Protection (‘the Delegate’) to refuse to grant the Applicant a Student Temporary (Class TU) visa (‘the visa’) under s.65 of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) (‘the Act’). The Applicant has been in Australia since 18 February 2008, holding student visas. Condition 8516 of the Migration Regulations 1994 (Cth) (‘the Regulations’) applied to these visas and, in the Applicant’s case, obliged him to take a higher education sector course. Notwithstanding that, his studies did not go beyond a number of short courses and trade certificates. The Applicant applied to the Department of Immigration and Citizenship (as it then was) (‘the Department’) for a further student (temporary) visa (‘the visa’) on 8 July 2012.  The Delegate refused to grant the visa on 3 October 2012.  The Delegate refused to grant the visa because the Applicant did not satisfy the requirements of cl.572.223 of sch.2 to the Regulations. The Delegate was not satisfied that the Applicant genuinely intended to stay temporarily in Australia as a student, as evidenced by his migration history; his non-compliance with previous student visa conditions; his failure to study for certain periods of time; and his completion of minimal academic qualifications. On 10 July 2012, shortly after the Applicant lodged his visa application, the Department wrote to him and sought further material, including a “statement of purpose”. The Department explained the statement should set out the Applicant’s reasons for undertaking the course of study specified in his visa application and provided guidance as to the contents of the statement. The Department also alerted the Applicant to adverse information concerning his application and invited him to comment. The information was identified in the following terms:-  “Information available to the Department indicates that you did not attend any course of study from November 2008 to July 2010, and then again from April 2011 to December 2011.  This is a cumulative study gap of 28 months, during which time you held visas with full study rights and departed from Australia for a period of only two months.  Further, it appears that although you have been twice granted TU 573 visas you have never commenced a course in the Higher Education Sector.  In fact, it appears that since your arrival in Australia on 18 February 2008, your studies have never progressed beyond the vocational educational level.”[3]  The Applicant did not provided a “statement of purpose” and did not provide written comment on this adverse information.  He did, however, before the Tribunal, seek to address concerns arising from gaps in his studies in Australia. The Applicant appeared before the Tribunal on 19 June 2014 to give evidence and present arguments.  He was represented in relation to the review by his registered migration agent.  Just prior to the hearing, the Tribunal had been provided with some evidence of studies undertaken during the Applicant’s time in Australia.  That evidence was a confirmation of enrolment for a Diploma of marketing, a course scheduled to commence on 26 May 2014.  This document was created shortly after the Applicant was forwarded a hearing invitation letter by the Tribunal. Legislation  The relevant subclass for the Tribunal to consider was subclass 572 of sch.2 to the Regulations. The Tribunal correctly identified the issue in the Applicant’s case was whether he met the time of decision criterion in cl.572.223 of sch.2 to the Regulations. Such clause relevantly states:-  “(1) The Minister is satisfied that the applicant is a genuine applicant for entry and stay as a student because:  (a) the Minister is satisfied that the applicant intends genuinely to stay in Australia temporarily, having regard to:  (i) the applicant’s circumstances; and  (ii) the applicant’s immigration history; and  (iii) if the applicant is a minor — the intentions of a parent, legal guardian or spouse of the applicant; and  (iv) any other relevant matter; and  (b) the applicant meets the requirements of subclause (2).  (2) An applicant meets the requirements of this subclause if:  (a) the applicant gives the Minister evidence in accordance with the requirements mentioned in Schedule 5A for the highest assessment level for the applicant; and  (b) the Minister is satisfied that the applicant is a genuine applicant for entry and stay as a student, having regard to:  (i) the stated intention of the applicant to comply with any conditions subject to which the visa is granted; and  (ii) any other relevant matter; and  (c) the Minister is satisfied that, while the applicant holds the visa, the applicant will have access to the funds demonstrated or declared in accordance with the requirements in Schedule 5A relating to the applicant’s financial capacity.” In considering whether the Applicant satisfied the criterion, the Tribunal noted that it must have regard to Direction Number 53 “Assessing the Genuine Temporary Entrant Criterion for Student Visa Applications” made under s.499 of the Act. The Tribunal noted the direction required it to have regard to a number of specified factors in relation to:- the Applicant’s circumstances in his own country, potential circumstances in Australia and the value of the course to the Applicant’s future; the Applicant’s immigration history, including previous applications for an Australian visa or for visas to other country and previous travel to Australia or other countries; if the Applicant is a minor, the intentions of a parent, legal guardian or spouse of the Applicant; and any other relevant information provided by the Applicant or information otherwise available to the decision-maker, including information that may be either beneficial or unfavourable to the Applicant. The Tribunal noted that the directions indicated that the factors specified should not be used as a checklist, but, rather, are intended to guide decision-makers to weigh up the Applicant’s circumstances as a whole in reaching a finding about whether the Applicant satisfies the genuine temporary entrant criterion. The Tribunal considered the Applicant’s claims and evidence and made findings. The Tribunal considered the Applicant’s evidence to be deliberately confusing, vague and, at times, evasive and inconsistent.  The Tribunal considered the Applicant intended to be so.[4] As correctly summarised by the First Respondent’s submissions, the Tribunal found the Applicant’s claim to be a genuine applicant for entry and stay in Australia was undermined by:  “(a) its finding that the applicant was not enrolled in a registered course between 23 April 2011 and December 2011:  (b) the applicant was proposing to study a vocational education course when he had been in Australia for six and a half years and initially entered Australia holding a visa on the basis of enrolment in a bachelor degree:  (c) its finding the applicant had enrolled in a course offering a diploma in marketing only as a result of the Tribunal inviting him to attend a hearing:  (d) the lack of detail or explanation as to how his asserted “personal life difficulties” prevented him from studying between August 2013 and May 2014:  (e) the applicant had not yet commenced or completed any studies at a degree level and had instead obtained certificates and diplomas.  This academic record was described as “not particularly good” in the context of a six and a half year stay in Australia:  (f) his proposed further studies would do little to assist him in operating a future business in India in light of the studies already undertaken.  The Tribunal considered the current enrolment was designed to prolong his stay in Australia.  The Tribunal made this finding in light of the evidence and material before it, including the applicant’s evidence at the hearing.”[5] The Tribunal concluded, at paragraph 52 to 53 of the Decision Record, as follows:-  “52. On the basis of the above, and having considered the applicant’s circumstances, immigration history, and other matters it considers relevant, the Tribunal is not satisfied that the applicant intends genuinely to stay in Australia temporarily.  Accordingly, the applicant does not meet cl.572.223(1)(a).  53. The Tribunal has found the applicant does not meet an essential requirement of cl.572.223.  With the exception of Subclass 580, the other subclasses within visa Class TU all contain an identical requirement.  For reasons given above, the Tribunal also finds that the applicant does not meet the requirements of these subclasses.  In respect of Subclass 580 (Student Guardian) visa, there is no material before the Tribunal that suggests the applicant meets the prescribed criteria for that subclass.  As the Tribunal has found that the applicant does not meet a criterion for the grant of a student visa, it must affirm the decision under review.”[6] Consideration  As indicated earlier in these Reasons, the Applicant's Application does not identify any ground of jurisdictional error.  Rather, he wishes to again agitate the merits of his visa application.  That is not a matter for this Court and there is, thus, no prospect of the Applicant succeeding in his application for judicial review.   Further, on a careful reading of the Tribunal decision, there is no jurisdictional error attending same.  The Tribunal made findings on the basis of the evidence and materials before it, and those findings were open to it.  It applied the correct legal principles, identified all relevant issues for its consideration, and afforded to the Applicant procedural fairness. It concluded that the Applicant had no intention of undertaking or completing a degree course in Australia and such lack of intention existed from the outset.   Accordingly, the Application for reinstatement will be dismissed and costs should follow the event. The costs as claimed by the First Respondent are in accordance with this Court’s schedule scale of costs and are reasonable in all the circumstances.I certify that the preceding twenty-one (21) paragraphs are a true copy of the reasons for judgment of Judge HartnettAssociate:  Date:  19 August 2015 [1] Letter from Clayton Utz to the Applicant dated 16 February 2015.[2] Ibid.[3] Email from the Department of Immigration and Citizenship to the Applicant requesting further information dated 10 July 2012.[4] Migration Review Tribunal Decision Record at [34].[5] First Respondent’s Outline of Submissions filed on 9 June 2015at [25].[6] Migration Review Tribunal Decision Record at [52] to [53].       \",\n",
       " 'Sayadi v Minister for Immigration & Anor [2015] FCCA 1829 (30 June 2015)': '  This is an application in a case in matter with the Court’s jurisdiction under s.476 of the Migration Act 1958.  The applicant seeks to have set aside an order summarily dismissing the proceedings in circumstances where the applicant had failed to appear.  The applicant has put on evidence to provide an explanation for his failure to attend.  That application was one which was filed on 17 June 2015, and the order summarily dismissing the proceedings was made on 28 May 2015.   The applicant identified that he attended a doctor because he was feeling unwell and obtained a medical certificate, as well as a prescription for some antibiotics.  The medical certificate identified that he would be unfit to continue his usual occupation.  The applicant candidly acknowledged that his current position was one where he was unemployed.  The applicant explained that he did not ask for a more specific certificate, and it is clear from the cross-examination that the applicant was able to communicate on the day the matter was listed for hearing. The applicant was candid in his response to the cross-examination about his medical condition, and I would accept that the applicant was unwell on 28 May 2015, insofar as the requirement for an explanation of delay is concerned.  I am not, however, satisfied that there is any arguable case sufficient to warrant the setting aside of the order that was made. Further there would be no utility in doing so as the proceedings are doomed to failure.  In this case the delegate refused to grant the applicant a visa because the applicant did not meet the requirements of cl.602.211 as he had not satisfied Schedule 3, Criteria 3001.  The Tribunal correctly identified that in order to satisfy the criteria 3001, the application for the visa must have been lodged within 28 days of the relevant date.  In this case the Tribunal found that the applicant’s last substantive visa ceased on 21 September 2013.  It was in those circumstances that the Tribunal made the following findings:  10. In this case the decision record of the Department provided by the applicant to the Tribunal indicates that the applicant’s last held substantive visa ceased on 21 September 2013. The visa application indicates that the applicant was living in Australia. The Tribunal finds that 21 September 2013 is the relevant day for the purpose of this case.  11. This decision record also indicates that the applicant applied for this visa on 12 January 2015 although the visa application is date stamped 13 January 2015. The Tribunal finds that this application was made to the Department on 13 January 2015. This means the application was not lodged within 28 days of the relevant day.  12. The applicant stated to the Tribunal that he held a bridging visa at the time he applied for the Subclass 602 visa and he had held bridging visas for about 1.5 years. After holding student visas he applied for a Subclass 485 visa and he met the criteria but his migration agent made errors. He received poor advice and did not lodge an appeal about the refusal of the Subclass 485 visa. He changed agents and tried for different visas but the Department rang him and said his visa had ceased. He was shocked and went to his doctor who referred him to a specialist. He developed insomnia and had a motor vehicle accident. He still suffers from insomnia and poor memory. He tried to commit suicide last year and was admitted to RPA Hospital for 1 day and then referred to community services. He now takes Zoloft and Valium, and sees his doctor. He cannot live in Lebanon and does not want to return there. He has lived in Australia for 5 years and if he has to leave he will investigate whether he can go to another country, other than Lebanon.   13. The Tribunal has considered all the available evidence but as explained at hearing, the Tribunal has no discretion to take other circumstances into account. As the visa application was not made within 28 days of the relevant day, the applicant does not satisfy criterion 3001.    14. Based on the findings above, the applicant does not meet the requirements for the grant of the visa. The decision under review must be affirmed. The Tribunal did not have jurisdiction on compassionate grounds to overcome the non-compliance with the criteria under 3001.  The application identifies the following grounds:  1. The decision of the Migration Review Tribunal does not support my application based on Schedule 3 that I did not hold a substantive visa at the time of my application yet failed to take into consideration my compelling and compassionate circumstances as per evidence submitted concerning medical condition.  2. My migration agent, Sam Issa, is also liable and responsible for the outcome of the 485 visa. He failed to act properly and currently under investigation. I ask the Honourable Court to consider his behaviour as responsible for the failure to lodge a review for 485 subclass. Ground 1 is without substance as the Tribunal did not have jurisdiction to consider compelling and compassionate circumstances to overcome the non-compliance and, accordingly, ground 1 has no prospect of success.  Ground 2 fails to identify any jurisdictional error, and it is clear that the application fails to disclose any arguable jurisdictional error.   The Court has had the benefit of the Court book that identified the invitation to the applicant to attend the hearing, as well as the delegate’s decision adverse to the applicant. I am satisfied that this is a case in which there is no utility in setting aside the order made on 28 May 2015, and that the interests of the administration of justice do not warrant any such order.  The application in the case is dismissed.  I certify that the preceding seven (7) paragraphs are a true copy of the reasons for judgment of Judge StreetAssociate:  Date: 3 July 2015       ',\n",
       " 'Sidhu v Minister for Immigration & Anor [2015] FCCA 3507 (10 December 2015)': '  These reasons concern an application in a case filed by the applicant pursuant to r.16.05 of the Federal Circuit Court Rules 2001 (“Rules”) seeking to set aside a decision of Registrar Hannigan made on 29 October 2015 on the basis that the registrar’s orders were made in his absence. The applicant commenced proceedings in this Court by an application filed on 12 February 2015 in which he sought judicial review of a decision made by the Migration Review Tribunal (“Tribunal”), a predecessor of the second respondent, affirming a decision made by a delegate of the first respondent (“Minister”) to refuse him a Partner (Temporary) (Class UK) subclass 820 visa.  The applicant’s application was listed for its first court date on 5 March 2015.  The applicant appeared in court on that date when his application was summarily dismissed by Judge Street on the basis that it had no reasonable prospects of success: Sidhu v Minister for Immigration & Anor [2015] FCCA 507.  The applicant appealed to the Federal Court.  By consent orders made on 21 July 2015, the matter was remitted to this Court.  Following that remittal, the Court’s registry sent to the applicant a letter dated 16 September 2015 advising him that his case had been listed for directions before a registrar on 29 October 2015.  There was no appearance by or for the applicant on that occasion and on the Minister’s application the proceedings were dismissed pursuant to r.13.03C(i)(c) of the Rules.   The considerations which are, in my view, relevant to whether to grant the present application for re-instatement are whether the applicant’s explanation for his non-attendance on 29 October 2015 is a satisfactory one and whether, nevertheless, his allegations in the substantive application have reasonable prospects of success (see r.13.10(a) of the Rules). SATISFACTORY EXPLANATION   Turning first to the issue whether the applicant has provided a satisfactory explanation for his non-attendance, in his affidavit in support of his application in a case he deposed that he had been unable to attend court on 29 October 2015 because he had been suffering from diarrhoea.  In his evidence to the Court at the hearing of this application the applicant essentially reiterated what he had said in his affidavit.   The applicant was cross-examined by Mr Pinder on behalf of the Minister and, as a result of that cross-examination, some incongruous circumstances did emerge, most particularly, in my view, that although the applicant had, on his evidence, been unwell during the night and so must have been aware in the morning of 29 October 2015 that he would be unable to attend court, he did not seek to advise the Court before 10:15am on 29 October or, indeed, until the afternoon of that day, that he would be or had been unable to attend court. The question arises why the applicant advised the Court so late and the explanation which suggests itself is that the applicant had not been ill.  However, the applicant really had nothing to gain by failing to attend the directions hearing and so there appears no motive to tell an untruth.  In such circumstances and also having had regard to the applicant’s demeanour in the witness box, including what appeared to me to be an authentic air to at least some of his evidence, I am prepared to accept that he was unwell on the day of the directions hearing before the registrar and that his explanation for non-attendance is a satisfactory one. ARGUABLE CASE  However, the application to set aside the registrar’s orders will not be granted unless the applicant has a case for judicial review with reasonable prospects of success.  In this regard, it should be noted that in proceedings for judicial review of a Tribunal decision the Court cannot rehear the visa application underlying that decision.  Its task is to determine whether the relevant Tribunal decision is affected by jurisdictional error as that is the only basis upon which it can be set aside: s.474 of the Migration Act 1958 (“Act”); Plaintiff S157/2002 v Commonwealth (2003) 211 CLR 476.  Consequently, the applicant will not have made out his case to set aside the registrar’s orders unless he can demonstrate that he has reasonable prospects of proving in the substantive proceedings that the Tribunal’s decision is affected by jurisdictional error.   Relevant legislation   The criteria for the grant of a Partner (Temporary) (Class UK) subclass 820 visa are set out in pt.820 of sch.2 to the Migration Regulations 1994 (“Regulations”).  One of the criteria which the applicant had to satisfy at the time he made his application was cl.820.211.  It relevantly provided:  (2) An applicant meets the requirements of this subclause if:  (a) the applicant is the spouse or de facto partner of a person who:  (i) is an Australian citizen, an Australian permanent resident or an eligible New Zealand citizen; and  (ii) is not prohibited by subclause (2B) from being a sponsoring partner; and  (c) the applicant is sponsored:  (i) if the applicant’s spouse or de facto partner has turned 18—by the spouse or de facto partner;   ...  (d) in the case of an applicant who is not the holder of a substantive visa ... :  ...  (ii) the applicant satisfies Schedule 3 criteria 3001, 3003 and 3004, unless the Minister is satisfied that there are compelling reasons for not applying those criteria. The sch.3 criteria which were relevant to the applicant’s application were criteria 3001 and 3004.  They relevantly provided:  3001  (1) The application is validly made within 28 days after the relevant day (within the meaning of subclause (2)).  (2) For the purposes of subclause(1) ... the relevant day, in relation to an applicant, is:  ...  (c) if the applicant:  (i) ceased to hold a substantive ... visa on or after 1 September 1994; ...  ...  whichever is the later of:  (iii) the last day when the applicant held a substantive ... visa;   ...  3004  If the applicant:  (a) ceased to hold a substantive ... visa on or after 1 September 1994; ...  ...  the Minister is satisfied that:  (c) the applicant is not the holder of a substantive visa because of factors beyond the applicant’s control; and  (d) there are compelling reasons for granting the visa; and  (e) the applicant has complied substantially with:  ...  (ii) the conditions that apply or applied to:  (A) the last of any substantive visas held by the applicant (other than a condition of which the applicant was in breach solely because the visa ceased to be in effect); and  (B) any subsequent bridging visa; and  (f) either:  (i) in the case of an applicant referred to in paragraph (a) — the applicant would have been entitled to be granted a visa of the class applied for if the applicant had applied for the visa on the day when the applicant last held a substantive ... visa; or  ...  (g) the applicant intends to comply with any conditions subject to which the visa is granted; ... Background facts  The applicant is a citizen of India who arrived in Australia on 17 November 2008 as the holder of a student visa which expired on 15 March 2011.  On 11 June 2013 he applied for a subclass 820 partner visa.  His application was sponsored by his de facto partner who is an Australian citizen.  In his application the applicant stated that he met his partner on 29 June 2012, began a relationship with her on 8 December 2012 and committed to sharing a life with her on 29 June 2013.  Amongst other documents, he provided a relationship certificate indicating that he and his sponsor had registered their de facto relationship with the NSW Registry of Births, Deaths and Marriages on 14 March 2013. In the covering letter accompanying his application the applicant acknowledged that his last substantive visa had expired more than twenty-eight days before he had lodged his partner visa application and that he would need to satisfy the requirements of sch.3 to the Regulations.  However, he sought a waiver of those requirements on the basis that there were compelling reasons to grant him the.  In support of that argument he provided a statutory declaration dated 18 November 2013 in which he stated: before the expiry of his student visa he had met an agent who had promised to lodge an employer-sponsored visa on his behalf but he had been defrauded and no visa was lodged on his behalf; he had lodged his partner visa application while in Australia rather than returning to India and lodging it from there because he and his sponsor had promised never to be apart.  It would have been hard for them and would have adversely impacted their relationship if he had returned to India to lodge the application.  He was also the principal breadwinner and if he had left for India his sponsor’s income would not have been sufficient to meet all their financial commitments; and he had asked his sponsor to return with him to India to lodge his application but they had decided not to go to India because: his sponsor’s life would have been in danger. Many foreigners in India were robbed, raped and abused and his sponsor was afraid of being raped in India; his sponsor could not speak any of the Indian languages and moving there would have affected her career aspirations; his sponsor owned a horse in Australia which would have been difficult for her to leave; and they did not have the financial means to travel overseas and live there for the extended period of time it would take to process his application. On 6 December 2013 the delegate refused the applicant’s application on the basis that he did not satisfy cl.820.211 of sch.2 of the Regulations.  The delegate also found that the applicant had ceased to hold a substantive visa more than twenty-eight days prior to lodging his application, and so did not meet criterion 3001 of sch.3 of the Regulations.  She was also not satisfied that there were compelling reasons to waive the sch.3 criteria. On 24 December 2013 the applicant applied to the Tribunal for review of the delegate’s decision.  At a Tribunal hearing on 14 January 2015 he relevantly stated: his relationship with his sponsor had broken down a month before the hearing and she was living with her parents.  She had not yet formally withdrawn her sponsorship but had told him that she intended to withdraw it; after his student visa expired he met a man who owned a restaurant who had promised to sponsor him.  He paid the man $25,000 but the man took his passport and disappeared; and his sponsor did not want to live in India and her parents had told her that she could not travel there.  It would be difficult for them to find work and they would have to be dependent on his parents. The Tribunal’s decisions and reasons  The Tribunal noted that the applicant’s last substantive visa had ceased on 15 March 2011 and that he had made his application for the partner visa on 11 June 2013.  In those circumstances it found that he had not applied for a visa within twenty-eight days of his last substantive visa and therefore did not satisfy criterion 3001 of sch.3 of the Regulations. The Tribunal went on to consider whether there were compelling reasons for not applying the sch.3 criteria but it was not satisfied that the matters raised by the applicant were compelling reasons for not applying those criteria.  In that regard: the Tribunal noted that the applicant had been in Australia unlawfully for more than two years before lodging his partner visa application.  It found that there was no independent evidence to suggest that the applicant had made any attempts to regularise his status and did not accept his evidence that he had been deceived by a man who had agreed to sponsor him amounted to a compelling reason to waive criterion 3001; while the Tribunal accepted that at the time the applicant lodged his visa application he and his sponsor had not wished to be separated, it did not consider that any unhappiness arising or resulting from such a separation was a compelling reason to waive the sch.3 criteria. It found that the applicant and his sponsor could have continued to provide each other with emotional support through the array of available communication tools; the Tribunal was not satisfied that at the time the applicant lodged his application his sponsor had been financially dependent on him or that she would have suffered psychological or material hardship if he had departed Australia.  It did not accept that her claimed financial or emotional dependence was a compelling reason to not apply the sch.3 criteria; while accepting that it might have been difficult for the applicant’s sponsor to find work in India and that they might have had to be financially dependent on the applicant’s parents while his visa application was being processed, the Tribunal did not consider those matters to be compelling reasons for waiving the sch.3 criteria; the Tribunal accepted that the applicant’s sponsor owned a horse and was concerned for its welfare and that she might have preferred not to be separated from it.  However, it found that that was not a compelling reason for waiving the sch.3 criteria; the Tribunal accepted that the applicant’s sponsor might not have felt safe travelling to or residing in India but found that it would have been open to her to remain in Australia while the applicant’s application was processed;  the Tribunal noted that the applicant and his sponsor had registered their de facto relationship in March 2013, three months before the applicant lodged his partner visa application.  It was therefore not satisfied that their relationship had been of long standing at the time of that application.  It also noted that they did not have any Australian-born children; and the Tribunal had regard to the fact that the applicant and his sponsor had separated and that the sponsor had not appeared at his hearing to present evidence about any compelling circumstances which had existed at the time of the applicant’s application. Proceedings in this Court  In his originating application filed on 12 February 2015 the applicant alleged:  1. My application was refused on the basis of not meeting Schedule 3.  2. I had provided DIBP office my evidence of compelling reason which they did not accept, due to this stress, it put a large impact on my relationship.  While my application was in MRT, I also told the case officer that my relationship had broken down.  After the hearing of MRT, I reconciled with my partner as we cannot live apart, it was a temporary separation due to some misunderstanding and we are now together again.  3. I trust that I was unable to provide good reasons of my compelling circumstances to Migration Review Tribunal due to level of Stress and Ups and downs in my relationship with my partner.  4. I truly believe that I have compelling and compassionate reasons for seeking a waiver of Schedule 3 and firmly believe that I should be granted a visa. At the hearing of this application the applicant also argued that the Tribunal should have contacted his partner so that she could give evidence at the Tribunal hearing and, further, that his evidence concerning having been defrauded by a potential sponsor was a circumstance sufficient to justify the waiving of the sch.3 criteria.   Ground 1  The first ground of the application is no more than a description of the Tribunal’s finding and does not allege any error on its part.   Ground 2    The second ground of the application speaks of the applicant’s reconciliation with his partner after the Tribunal hearing and impliedly alleges that the Tribunal should have had regard to this.  However, the applicant did not suggest that he had made the Tribunal aware of this reconciliation and para.35 of the Tribunal’s reasons indicates that the Tribunal was unaware of it.  As there is no basis to conclude that the Tribunal was aware of the claimed reconciliation, there is similarly no basis to conclude that its apparent failure to consider it amounted to an error. Ground 3   The burden of the third ground of the application is that the applicant was unable to put his case to the Tribunal properly because of his emotional state at the time of the Tribunal hearing.  No evidence was adduced to support such a proposition.  Consequently, there is no reason to conclude that the applicant was denied the meaningful hearing implicitly guaranteed to him by s.360 of the Act. Ground 4  The fourth ground of the application invited the Court to undertake a review of the merits of the visa application, something which the Court cannot do.   Ground 5  Turning to the first of the matters which the applicant raised at the hearing, the Tribunal will only be required to make inquiries on its own account in a narrow range of circumstances, none of which appears to be present in this case.  The suggestion that the Tribunal should have contacted the applicant’s partner does not fall into those circumstances because, as the Tribunal recorded at para.22 of its reasons, the applicant had told it that his relationship with his sponsor had broken down about approximately a month earlier and that she intended to withdraw the sponsorship.  In those circumstances, it would have been apparent to the Tribunal that nothing was to be gained, at least in the context of the applicant’s request that the sch.3 criteria not be applied, in calling the applicant’s partner and so no error was committed by the Tribunal in not attempting to arrange her attendance.   In those circumstances, there is similarly no basis to find that the Tribunal should have adjourned its hearing so that the applicant’s partner could attend.  Not only is there no record in the Tribunal’s reasons of the applicant having sought an adjournment so that his partner could attend but, for the reasons already given, it would have appeared to the Tribunal that nothing would have been gained from such an adjournment.  Ground 6    The allegation made at the hearing of this application concerning the fraudulent sponsor was, like para.4 of the application, an invitation to engage in merits review and thus does not provide a basis to find jurisdictional error on the Tribunal’s part.   CONCLUSION   Although I have concluded that the applicant’s explanation for failing to attend the directions hearing on 29 October 2015 is a satisfactory one, none of the allegations which he has raised in connection with his substantive application appear to have reasonable prospects of success.  That is to say, I am not persuaded that the applicant has, based on the matters which he has raised, reasonable prospects of demonstrating that the Tribunal’s decision is affected by jurisdictional error.  In the circumstances, it would not be appropriate to set the registrar’s decision aside.   The applicant’s application in a case will therefore be dismissed.

       " 'Singh & Anor v Minister for Immigration & Anor [2015] FCCA 3094 (23 November 2015)': ' Introduction   The primary applicant in these proceedings is Mrs Alka Singh.  On 4 March 2013, she applied for a student (temporary) class TU Visa,[1] pursuant to the provisions of section 65 of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) “the Act”.  The grant of the visa is subject to the satisfaction of a number of criteria described in the Migration Regulations 1994, in particular clause 572.224 contained in schedule 2 of the Regulations.  This clause attracts public interest criterion 4020[2] contained in Part 1 of Schedule 4 of the Regulations.  In general terms, PIC 4020 requires, prior to the granting of the visa in question, that: There is no evidence before any relevant decision maker that a bogus document or information that is false or misleading in a material particular has been provided in respect of the application for the visa concerned;  The applicant and each member of the dependant family unit has not been refused a visa because of a failure to satisfy PIC 4020 in the preceding period of three years.   Pursuant to the provisions of PIC 4020(5), the requirement relating to the vitiation of any visa application, because of the production of a bogus document or the provision of false or misleading information, may be waived, if there are compelling circumstances, affecting the interests of Australia or an Australian citizen or permanent resident sufficient to justify the granting of the visa in question.   The secondary applicant, in these proceedings, is Manjinder Singh.  He is the husband of the primary applicant.  Both applicants are citizens of India.  Following their arrival in Australia, on 5 March 2013, the primary applicant was requested to supply further information in respect of her visa application.   Germane to these proceedings, she was requested to provide evidence that she had sufficient funds to support herself and any family members accompanying her, for the first twenty-four months of her stay in Australia, whilst she pursued her studies in this country.  On 3 April 2013, the primary applicant provided copies of statements relating to deposits held in the Canara Bank, at its branch at Janakpuri, New Delhi.  On 2 July 2013, a delegate of the Minister for Immigration & Border Protection wrote to Mrs Singh and indicated that the Department had reason to believe that although the various fixed deposits, at the Canara Bank existed, they did not match the identity of the sponsor of the primary applicant – her mother in India.  Given the circumstances, the delegate asked Mrs Singh to comment on this information.   Mrs Singh responded to this request in a letter dated 20 July 2013, in which was enclosed an affidavit from Veena Rani, the applicant’s sponsor and new financial documents.  The earlier bank statements from the Canara Bank had been in the name of Veena Rani. In her letter, the primary applicant claimed that the bank in question had sent her the wrong documents, which she had sent on without checking.  She professed herself to have been astonished that the documents were bogus.  On 30 August 2013, the Minister’s delegate declined to grant the visa in question.  In his decision, the delegate said as follows:  “Although the applicant has provided additional financial documents to support her application, this new evidence does not address the fact that the original documents were fraudulent.   In summary, I am not satisfied that the applicant has proved that she did not provide a fraudulent document as part of her visa application and therefore I am not satisfied that the applicant meets Public Interest Criteria 4020.”[3] This decision was subject to review in the Migration Review Tribunal.  The review application was lodged on 16 September 2013.  On 13 November 2014, the Migration Review Tribunal affirmed the earlier decision of the Minister’s delegate not to grant the applicant’s the visa.  It is this decision, which is the subject of the current application before the court.   The Migration Review Tribunal has been abolished.  Its functions are now carried out by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal.  I will refer to the relevant decision maker, in these reasons for judgment as “the Tribunal”.  The grounds of review  The primary applicant has prepared her own grounds for review, which were filed in the court on 3 December 2014.  She seeks an order that the Tribunal decision be quashed.  The sole ground of her application is as follows:  “I wish to submit my application to review my case in court as it was dismissed by DIPB & MRT.  I applied for Student visa subclass 572 which got refused due to fraudulent financial documents submitted by my agent then without our knowledge.  I was not even aware that the financial document for funds had been submitted to Department.  The respected MRT member did not considered the factors of ours being unrelated and unknown with the issue and it was therefore difficult for me to explain my opinions and defend my claims which had affected the outcome significantly in opinion.  I thereby request the court to accept my application for further hearing and provide justice to my case as I have all the required documents & I have many points to submit in front the Hon. Judge.” The applicable legal considerations  The legal principles applying to applications of this type are complex.  I will do my best to explain them.  In simple terms, the process of judicial review is not a re-hearing of the original application, in which this court is free to substitute its own findings of fact and exercise its own discretion in place of what the original decision-maker did.   Rather, what an applicant for judicial review must establish is that there is some form of legal error in what the original decision maker decided or how it was decided, which caused the Tribunal in question not to properly exercise the jurisdiction conferred upon it.   Accordingly, the focus, in these proceedings, is on whether there has been a jurisdictional error in the decision of the Migration Review Tribunal.  Part VIII of the Act deals with judicial review.  Pursuant to section 476(1), this court has the same original jurisdiction, as does the High Court, in what are termed migration decisions.   Pursuant to paragraph 75(v) of the Constitution, the High Court has authority to grant prerogative writs against any officer of the Commonwealth.  Accordingly, in migration decisions, this court has authority to quash the decision of the MRT by way of a writ of certiorari, which is what, in effect, the applicant seeks.   However, pursuant to section 476(2), the Federal Circuit Court has no jurisdiction in respect of what are termed to be privative clause decisions.  A migration decision is defined, in the applicable provision of the Act, as such a privative clause decision.[4]  Pursuant to section 474, privative clauses are deemed to be final and conclusive and as such, must not be challenged or reviewed in any court or subject to writs of certiorari or mandamus. Accordingly, the decision in question, in these proceedings, being a migration decision is also a privative clause decision.  As such, the court does not have jurisdiction to re-hear the matter, as a consequence of the provisions contained in section 474 of the Act.   However, in a number of cases, the High Court has held that the provisions of section 474 do not prevent the review of decisions, made by Tribunals, which are affected by jurisdictional error or have been made in bad faith.[5] In general terms, an administrative Tribunal exceeds its powers and thus falls into jurisdictional error, if it identifies a wrong issue; asks a wrong question; ignores relevant material; relies on irrelevant material; or, in some circumstances, makes an erroneous finding or reaches a mistaken conclusion, in a way that affects the exercise or purported exercise of the power conferred upon it.[6] As previously indicated, jurisdictional error is a complex concept.  In addition to the matters listed above, it can also encompass a breach of procedural fairness or a denial of natural justice, as it has been held that such breaches have the consequence of vitiating the jurisdiction of the Tribunal concerned and be in themselves errors of jurisdiction.   The decision of the Tribunal  The procedure to be followed by the Tribunal, on the hearing of a review application, is set out in Division 5 of the Migration Act.  Pursuant to section 360 the Tribunal is required to invite any applicant to appear before it to give evidence and present arguments which relate to the issues arising in relation to the decision under review.   Such an invitation was proffered to the applicants, which they took up.  The central issue before the Tribunal was the nature and consequence of the bank records, relating to the various deposits in the name of Veena held by the Canara Bank.  The applicants gave evidence to the Tribunal in respect of this issue.   I have not been provided with a transcript of the applicant’s evidence before the Tribunal.  However, it is clear from the relevant decision of the Tribunal and from the first applicant’s recent written submissions to this court, that it is the position of Mr & Mrs Singh they were the victims of a fraud committed by their previous migration agent, Mr Vishal Sharma.   At hearing, the Tribunal found that the owner of the accounts, with the Canara Bank, initially submitted to the Department, lived at an address some 400km away from the address of Mrs Singh’s sponsor.  Mrs Singh confirmed to an officer of the Department that her mother had lived at the same address for 25 years and had never been to Delhi, where the owner of the Canara Bank accounts was recorded as residing. The applicants do not dispute that neither they nor their Indian sponsor had any connection with the bank accounts in question.  However, it was their position before the Tribunal that they had no personal connection with the documents.  Accordingly they submitted to the Tribunal that they had neither knowledge nor had authorised the production of the banking records to the Tribunal.   Rather, Mrs Singh deposed that she had paid Mr Sharma a sum of $2,800.00 to assist her with the visa application.  This sum had been paid into an account nominated to her by Mr Sharma, whom she had not actually met face to face.  Mrs Singh apparently now is of the view that Mr Sharma is not a registered migration agent. The Tribunal questioned Mrs Singh as to whether she had reported her complaints, regarding the alleged misconduct of Mr Sharma, to either police or immigration authorities.  In this regard the Tribunal summarised Mrs Singh’s evidence as follows:  “The applicant’s evidence at hearing was that she threatened Mr Sharma with going to the police if he didn’t provide her with documents.  She claimed that he subsequently responded to her demands and provided her with details of the application and the email address and password (which she states he had improperly created in her name).  She did not give evidence that he returned the $2,800 which she paid to him directly to his Commonwealth bank account...”[7] It is clear from its reasons, that the Tribunal did not find this explanation credible.  It was dubious that Mrs Singh had not made a complaint to police and particularly had not provided the authorities with details of Mr Sharma’s bank account.  In the Tribunal’s view, these would have been relatively easy matters for her to accomplish. Overall, the Tribunal considered that the applicant’s responses to questions asked of her to be evasive, rehearsed and lacking credibility.  As such, the Tribunal rejected the applicants’ contention that the documents provided to the Department had been procured as a consequence of a fraud occasioned upon them by Mr Sharma. In addition, the Tribunal rejected the submission that the incorrect bank documents had been provided to the Department as a result of an inadvertent mix-up or some form of innocent mistake or administrative error.  As a consequence of these findings, the Tribunal concluded as follows:  “...the tribunal is satisfied that false or misleading information was provided in support of the visa application in the form of certifications from the Canara Bank as to deposits held with that financial institution purportedly in the name of the applicant’s mother.  Those accounts did not belong to the applicant’s mother but to a person with the same or similar name.”[8] Thereafter the Tribunal concluded that the requirements of PIC 4020 should not be waived, as there were no compelling or compassionate circumstances affecting the interests of any Australian citizen or permanent resident.  The Tribunal reached this conclusion after having asked Mrs Singh whether there were any such circumstances and she had indicated that she knew of none apart from her own studies. Conclusions  In their application, Mr and Mrs Singh focus on issues relating to the alleged fraud of Mr Sharma on them.  It is clear, in my view, from a plain reading of the reasons of the Tribunal that it did accept the contentions of the applicants, relating both to the purported fraud of Mr Sharma and the possibility that the documents in question had been provided as a consequence of some form of innocent mistake.  It rejected both such contentions. The Tribunal found that Mrs Singh was not a credible witness in respect of the evidence she provided in regards to Mr Sharma and the provenance of the bank records, which she conceded did not relate to her or her mother.   As McHugh J remarked in Minister for Immigration & Multicultural Affairs: Ex-parte Durairajasingham, a finding on credibility is a “function of the primary decision-maker par excellence”.[9] It is not open to this court, on a judicial review application, to undertake its own assessment of the evidence relating to the Canara Bank documents.  That is a function which falls solely within the remit of the Tribunal.  It found, as it was entitled to do, that the Canara Bank documents were bogus.  In my view, on the basis of the evidence available to it, the Tribunal could have reached no other conclusion on any rational or logical basis, given Mrs Singh’s acknowledgement that the holder of the accounts in question was not her mother. In my view, the tenor of the current application is that this court should conduct its own merits hearing into the allegations regarding the conduct of Mr Sharma and conclude that Mr and Mrs Singh have been the victims of his duplicity.  As previously indicated, this court is not empowered to conduct such a merits hearing.  It is entitled to intervene only if a jurisdictional error is established. In my view, it was open to the Tribunal to conclude that the application was vitiated by the provision of fraudulent information.  In this context, the Tribunal considered the definition of bogus document contained in section 97 of the Act.  It also considered what was said by the Full Court of the Federal Court in Trivedi & Ors v Minister for Immigration & Border Protection & Anor[10] and in particular whether it was necessary for the Tribunal to conclude that any applicant concerned was actually aware that purposely untrue information had been provided to it before PIC 4020 became engaged. In the case Buchanan J said as follows in respect of public interest criterion 4020:  “... it is equally clear that PIC 4020 is directed at the overall integrity of the visa system and as a bulwark against deception and fraught from any quarter associated with a visa applicant.  It is not inconsistent with a coherent public policy to make a visa applicant ultimately responsible for purposely untrue material provided with a visa application.  It would be an intolerable burden on the administration of the visa system to require that those assessing visa applications not only discover that information or documents are false in a material particular, but also that the visa applicant who provided them knew them to be so.  In many cases that would be impossible and would defeat the apparent intent of the provisions.” Accordingly, in the case, the Full Court concluded that the relevant criterion referred to information that was false, in the sense that it was purposely untrue and further that it was not necessary to conclude that a visa applicant was aware that the information was purposely untrue before the criterion was engaged.  In the current case, the Tribunal found that false and misleading information had been provided in support of the visa application.  It further rejected the applicants’ contention that they had been the victims of a fraud or an honest mistake.  As such, it was satisfied PIC 4020 was engaged.  I can see no jurisdictional error pertaining to this decision. In addition, in my view, there is no indication that the Tribunal failed to accord the applicants concerned the prerequisite degree of procedural fairness in respect of the issue of the misleading documents from the Canara Bank.  The applicants were given the opportunity to comment on the documents concerned and provide their explanation as to their provenance, which the Tribunal rejected, as it was entitled to do.  In this case, the documents concerned were undoubtedly false, as the accounts related to persons with whom the applicants had no connection.  Having reached this conclusion, it was not necessary for the Tribunal itself to conclude that the applicants themselves knew of the false nature of the documents.   As Buchanan J characterised it, PIC 4020 is a bulwark against deception.  Its purpose is to prevent the integrity of the migration visa system being undermined by deceit and manipulation.  The relevant documents in this case were clearly both false and misleading, in the sense they did not relate to Mrs Singh’s mother.   The Tribunal rejected the accounts provided by the applicants regarding their personal connection with the documents.  In these circumstances, in my view, PIC 4020 was clearly engaged and therefore the Tribunal had no logical or reasonable alternative other than to affirm the decision not to grant the visa in question. As such the reasons in question disclose no jurisdiction error. There being no discernible legal error, the application must be dismissed.  The first respondent seeks costs in the sum of $6,825.00.  In this case, I accept that costs should follow the result.  Given the abolition of the Migration Review Tribunal, I will make an order that the second respondent be replaced with the Administrative Appeals Tribunal.  For all these reasons, the orders of the court will be as set out at the commencement of these reasons for judgment.

       " 'Singh v Minister for Immigration & Anor [2015] FCCA 1853 (3 August 2015)': '  The Applicant seeks judicial review of a decision of the Migration Review Tribunal (“the Tribunal”) dated 6 October 2014.  The Applicant had sought a Student (Temporary) (Class TU) visa under s.65 of the Migration Act 1958 (“the Act”).  The Applicant made application for the visa on 5 June 2012, following which the delegate refused the visa on 18 January 2013.  Thereafter, the Applicant sought review by the Migration Review Tribunal, lodging his application on 25 January 2013.  The Tribunal made its decision on 6 October 2014.  The Applicant then sought judicial review of the Tribunal’s decision in an application lodged with the Court on 29 October 2014. The Minister argues that the application fails to raise an arguable case and should be dismissed pursuant to r.44.12(1)(a) of the Federal Circuit Court Rules 2001.   The decision concerned the evidence that was provided to satisfy the means test for financial support in cl.572.224 of sch.2 of the Migration Regulations 1994.  The Tribunal identified that the Applicant had submitted a financial document, purporting to be bank documents of his grandfather, which were, in fact, bank documents of another person with the same name.  Thereafter, the Applicant’s migration agent wrote to the delegate alleging that the allegations that the statements were not that of the grandfather were wrong.  The delegate concluded that the documents were bogus documents within the meaning of s.97 of the Act and refused the application.   At para.9 of the Tribunal’s decision (Court Book (“CB”) 231), the Tribunal identifies that the Applicant’s case was that he had provided correct documents as far as he was aware, but that his agent had made some errors.  When asked whether he had any explanation for the difficulties, he stated that he had a letter from his migration agent confirming that his grandfather was the account holder in respect of the documents.  The Tribunal advised that there was evidence that his grandfather was not the account holder and that the explanatory letter was also false.  The Tribunal found that the Applicant’s responses and explanations were evasive or non-responsive to the questions and did not accept him to be a witness of truth (see para.12, CB 231).  As a result, the Tribunal came to the conclusion that the Applicant was aware that false documents had been supplied. The information that the documents were false came from the Australian High Commission in India after integrity checking the documents.  The concerns as to the genuineness of the documents were expressed in an email from the Department to the Applicant’s agent on 15 October 2012, and received a response on 1 November 2012 from the agent enclosing a letter purporting to be from the bank confirming the documents were genuine and related to the Applicant’s grandfather.  This was duly referred to the Australian High Commission on 21 November 2012 and investigated, however the Australian High Commission did not change its conclusions.  Thereafter the application was refused.  When the Applicant applied to the Tribunal for review of the decision, he enclosed a copy of the delegate’s decision record.  It is not argued in this case that the Tribunal incorrectly dealt with the relevant provisions concerning bogus documents.  The grounds that the Applicant sets out in his application filed 29 October 2014 are as follows: I have applied for a Student Visa on 05.06.2012, with relevant documents.  The delegate refused to grant the visa on 07 March 2013 on the basis that I did not satisfy the requirements of cl.572.224 of Schedule 2 of the Migration Regulations 1994 (The Regulations) because in Coe reported satisfaction of the requirements of schedule 5A to the regulations I submitted a financial document relation to keep an account in name of the person as my grandfather but who on investigation was not found as my grandfather. I have applied to MRT to reconsider the decision made by the delegate.  I appeared before the Tribunal on 18.09.2014 to give evidence and present arguments.  The Tribunal also received oral evidence from my wife ‘Ms. Kamaljeet Kaur’. At the hearing, I told Tribunal that I had provided all correct documents but my agent had ‘mucked up somewhere’.  I also offered the Tribunal to provide more financial documents if required.  The Tribunal told me that the issue is whether the documents I had provided in the past were false and misleading in material particular or bogus. The Tribunal asked me regarding any explanations on which I told that I had a letter from migration agent that ‘the person mentioned’ is my grandfather, but I told them that I don’t have the letter on that day.  I repeatedly told the Tribunal that the person is my grandfather. I also told Tribunal that I could show the funds again if required. My wife also said that she is on 457 visa and she works full time.  We have a baby and I am the one who looks after the baby.  Thus my wife requested Tribunal that I could come on her visa and supports her. I request honourable authority to please consider my application and check all of my financial documents. Ground One  The first ground identifies a grammatical error in the Tribunal decision where a sentence appears not to make sense (having the appearance of the type of sentence constructed by a voice to text dictation software package).  It seems to me that, read in context, the sentence is sufficient to explain the background of the matter known to the parties.  In the context of this case, and the part of the decision in which this sentence appears, it does not appear to me that this shows an arguable basis for judicial review.   Ground Two  The second ground sets out that the Applicant applied and gave evidence, as did his wife.  There appears to be no dispute that these events occurred and this does not of itself appear to be a ground for review. Ground Three  The third ground simply sets out what occurred at the hearing, as summarised in the Tribunal decision.    Ground Four  The fourth ground again recounts what the Applicant told the Tribunal, namely that he believed the documents were those of his grandfather.  It is clear the Tribunal had regard to that evidence before making its findings.   Ground Five  The fifth ground proceeds on the basis that alternative evidence of funding could have been provided, however, as the Tribunal articulates, once an issue of whether or not a bogus document has been provided arises, this can (and in this case was) be an independent basis for refusing a visa application.  In the event that the Tribunal were entitled to refuse the application as a result of the bogus documents, it does not change the outcome even if the Applicant could have provided evidence of an alternative source of funding.   Ground Six  The sixth ground appears to be requesting that the Applicant be granted a visa as a dependent spouse of his wife given that she is on a 457 visa.  Whether or not such visa would be available to the Applicant is not for determination in these proceedings, but should be the subject of separate application to the Department for the relevant visa.   Ground Seven  This ground simply seeks to revisit the question of the Tribunal’s findings on a merits basis, which is not permissible in these proceedings.   I have turned my mind to whether or not the information that was central to this case was information that ought to have been the subject of the notice requirement under s.359A of the Act.  No such formal notice to the Applicant appears in the court book, yet clearly the information provided by the Australian High Commission was information of the type that would prima facie fall within the ambit of the statutory provision.   In this case however, a summary of that information appears in the decision of the delegate with considerable particularity.  Considering the matter from the perspective of the common law, there is no question that the Applicant had notice of this material and this issue before appearing before the Tribunal.  However, the operation of the provisions of the Act in this regard must be strictly complied with, and in particular s.359A.  In this case, the Minister argues that the information was, within the meaning of s.359A, provided by the Applicant in that the Applicant provided the delegate’s decision as part of the material for the review application.  Notably under the section, the information itself does not need to be given to the Applicant, simply that particulars of the information be provided to the Applicant.   In this case, the Applicant, by providing the delegate’s decision, has provided particulars of the information that is contrary to his case to the Tribunal.  The operation of the section in this regard was analysed in some detail in the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship v Chamnam You [2008] FCA 241, where it was concluded that particulars of information in a decision of a delegate is material given by the Applicant to the Tribunal, even if he or she is required to annexe that decision to the application.  In these circumstances, the particulars of the information concerned come within the exemption in s.359A(4)(b) and therefore the Tribunal did not have to provide a notice under that section. In the circumstances of this case, the Applicant therefore has no arguable ground to apply for judicial review and I therefore dismiss the application.  I certify that the preceding seventeen (17) paragraphs are a true copy of the reasons for judgment of Judge RiethmullerAssociate:  Date:  3 August 2015       ',\n",
       " 'Singh v Minister for Immigration & Anor [2015] FCCA 1916 (15 July 2015)': '  This is an application for a Constitutional writ within the court’s jurisdiction under s.476 of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth), in respect of a decision of the Tribunal, made on 16 April 2015, affirming a decision of the delegate not to grant the applicant a Bridging E (Class WE) visa. The applicant is a citizen of India and arrived in Australia on 17 January 2006, holding a Transit (TX-771) visa.  The applicant overstayed on this visa and applied to the Department for a Protection (Class XA) visa on 10 February 2006.  The applicant’s application for protection was refused on 27 March 2006 and affirmed by the Refugee Review Tribunal on 25 July 2006.  The applicant appealed the decision of the RRT to the Federal Magistrates Court, which upheld the Department’s decision. The applicant became an unlawful non-citizen in 2006 and remained unlawfully in Australia until 29 November 2010.  The applicant contacted the Department and advised that he wished to return to India and was granted a Bridging visa E on departure grounds.  The applicant did not depart Australia, and his last bridging visa ceased on 12 December 2011.  The applicant lodged an application for ministerial intervention on 24 March 2015 and at the same time lodged a further application for a Bridging visa E, which is the subject of these proceedings. The applicant had been unlawfully in Australia since the time that his last bridging visa ceased on 12 December 2011.  The applicant was interviewed at the detention centre on 1 April 2015 and his application for a Bridging visa E was refused by the delegate on 2 April 2015. The decision of the delegate was made on the basis that the delegate was not satisfied that the applicant would abide by the conditions of the visa.  It was in those circumstances that the applicant sought a review of the decision of the delegate and appeared before the Tribunal on 15 April 2015 to give evidence and present arguments. He was assisted by an interpreter and represented by a registered migration agent. Prior to the hearing, the Tribunal served upon the applicant a letter under s.359A in relation to the potentially dispositive issue as to whether the Tribunal could be satisfied that the applicant would abide the conditions that may be imposed on a Bridging visa if one was granted to him.  That letter set out the full migration history and unlawful periods by the applicant remaining in Australia without a visa and the failure to comply with the conditions imposed. The grounds in the application are as follows:    1. I wish to relodge protection visa application based on new evidence.  2. The Tribunal made Administrative error to take into account that I still have rights to lodge protection visa based on new evidence to grant me BVE visa. Orders were made on 11 June 2015, providing for an opportunity to the applicant to amend the application and put on any further evidence and also provide written submissions.  No documents were filed by the applicant. At the hearing today, the applicant said that his life is in danger and that he should be allowed to stay in Australia.  The applicant indicated that there was nothing further he wished to say in answer to the submissions of the first respondent or in support of his application. The first respondent submitted that this was an application that required an extension of time under s.477 and that the requirements in that regard were a satisfactory explanation for the delay, as well as the extent of the delay, and whether there is a sufficiently arguable ground of jurisdictional error to warrant an extension of time in the interests of the administration of justice. The first respondent submitted that although the delay was brief, the explanation was inadequate and, in particular, that it was the applicant’s responsibility to ascertain his review rights, referring to SZLIH v Minister of Immigration and Citizenship  [2009] FCA 108 at  [33]. The first respondent also submitted that ground 1 was misconceived and failed to identify a matter capable of being a jurisdictional error.  The first respondent submitted that the desire to make a further application for protection is not a matter that went to the issues before the Tribunal, which, critically, were whether or not the applicant would abide the conditions on the visa. The first respondent drew attention to the nature of those conditions which would be imposed on the visa under condition 8101 – being no work; condition 8401 – a requirement to report to the Department at a specified time and place; condition 8505 – to reside at a specific address; and condition 8506 – to notify a change of address. Those conditions were identified by the Tribunal at para.7.  The first respondent submitted that there was no substance in relation to ground 2 as it did not identify any legal error relating to the decision of the Tribunal. It was further submitted that the Tribunal provided the applicant with a genuine hearing, complied with the requirements in relation to the provisions of s.359A, complied with the obligations under Division 5, Part 5 and that the Tribunal made adverse findings that were open on the material available to the Tribunal. The first respondent submitted that the oral submissions by the applicant failed to identify any ground of error by the Tribunal. The applicant when invited to reply to the first respondent’s submissions indicated that he had nothing further to say. I accept the first respondent’s submission that the explanation for the delay is in the circumstances of this case inadequate.  I also accept the submission of the first respondent that the applicant has not identified any sufficiently arguable jurisdictional error to warrant an extension of time under s.477 in the interests of the administration of justice. I accept the first respondent’s submission that the issues raised in relation to the applicant’s desire to obtain a protection visa were not relevant to identifying any jurisdictional error by the Tribunal. I find that the grounds in the application fail to disclose any arguable jurisdictional error.  I accept the first respondent’s submission that the oral submissions of the applicant failed to identify any jurisdictional error. Relevantly, the Tribunal held:    9. The evidence before the Tribunal indicates that the applicant has been unlawful for significant periods of time. The first of these periods was between August 2006 and November 2010, a period of some four years. The second period of unlawfulness was between December 2011 and April 2015, a further period of some four years. Thus, since his arrival in Australia in 2006 the applicant has been unlawful for some eight years. The applicant has also failed to depart Australia when he was granted Bridging visas on that basis and failed a number of times to regularise his immigration status upon the expiry of his visas. ...  10. ...The applicant stated that his expenses are minimal. In response to the Tribunal’s comments that he has given conflicting information about his residence, the applicant stated that sometimes he stayed with friends for a short period but he has primarily lived at the temple.  ...  14. The Tribunal has considered the applicant’s claims that he intends to abide by the conditions on the visa if granted. The Tribunal considers that the applicant’s immigration history indicates that he has shown a considerable disregard of Australia’s immigration laws over a significant period of time. As set out above, the applicant has resided in Australia unlawfully for a period of eight years and whilst he has at times voluntarily approached the Department, at other times he has failed to report to the Department as required and has failed to abide by conditions on Bridging visas requiring him to depart Australia by a specified date. The Tribunal considers it unlikely that the applicant’s only employment has been on a volunteer basis at the temple during the nine years he has been in Australia, particularly given the regularity with which he telephoned the Department to request permission to work due to his need to support his family in India. The Tribunal also considers it unlikely that the applicant’s primary accommodation for the last nine years was at the temple in Griffith. The Tribunal is not satisfied that the letter from Mr Nagra establishes that the applicant’s residence was at the temple prior to his detention. However, even accepting that the applicant has resided at the temple and has only been engaged in volunteer activities for some nine years, the Tribunal is not satisfied that the applicant’s assertions in relation to his remorsefulness establish that he will abide by the conditions on the visa if it is granted. The Tribunal considers that the applicant’s past conduct raises considerable concerns that if released from detention he would continue to show disregard and disinterest in complying with Australia’s immigration laws. The Tribunal also considers that his past conduct indicates a considerable desire to remain living in the Australian community and that he will do whatever he considers necessary to remain in Australia. The Tribunal does not accept that the applicant has any intention of returning to India and considers his evidence that he will be in danger in India does not indicate that he would willingly return to India. The Tribunal has considerable concerns that if the applicant’s application to the Minister is unsuccessful that he would conceal himself in the community.  15. The Tribunal has considered the applicant’s evidence as to how he will support himself if he is released from the detention centre. The Tribunal accepts the bank statement provided after the hearing which shows that Mr Parshotam Singh has a bank balance of approximately $44,000 as of 16 April 2015. The Tribunal accepts the statements from Mr Parshotam Singh and Mr Sukwinder Singh that they are both willing and able to support the applicant. However, the Tribunal is not satisfied that their support will act as sufficient incentive to ensure the applicant will abide by the conditions on the visa. As stated above, the Tribunal has found that the applicant’s immigration is poor and indicative of disregard for Australia’s immigration laws. The Tribunal is prepared to accept that the applicant is remorseful at present for his poor immigration history, but is not satisfied that such remorse will result in the applicant complying with the conditions on his visa if his current application to the Minister is unsuccessful. Accordingly, the Tribunal is not satisfied that the applicant will reside at a specified address, report to the Department as required, and notify the Department of a change of address, thereby breaching conditions 8401, 8505 and 8506.   ...  17. ...The Tribunal has also not accepted that the applicant will depart Australia if his application for Ministerial intervention is unsuccessful. The Tribunal is not satisfied, having considered all of the evidence, that a sum of $15,000, or even a higher amount, will act as an incentive for the applicant to abide by the conditions on the visa. Therefore, on the evidence before it, the Tribunal is not satisfied that the applicant will abide by conditions imposed on the visa if granted. Therefore, the applicant does not meet cl.050.223.   18. For these reasons, the applicant does not satisfy the criteria for the grant of a Subclass 050 (Bridging (General)) visa.19. The visa application is also an application for a Subclass 051 (Bridging (Protection Visa Applicant)) visa. The applicant is not a relevant eligible non-citizen as set out in cl.051.211 of Schedule 2 to the Regulations and therefore does not meet the requirements for the grant of that visa.  I accept in the first respondent’s submissions that the adverse findings by the Tribunal were open and that the application fails to identify any arguable jurisdictional error and that the application for an extension of time under s.477 should be dismissed.I certify that the preceding nineteen (19) paragraphs are a true copy of the reasons for judgment of Judge StreetAssociate:  Date: 20 July 2015       ',\n",
       " 'Singh v Minister for Immigration & Anor [2015] FCCA 2451 (11 August 2015)': ' (Ex Tempore)  By application filed on 12 February 2015, the Applicant, Gurpreet Singh, seeks a review of a decision made by the then Migration Review Tribunal.   That decision was made on 9 January 2015, affirming the decision not to grant Mr Singh a student visa.   By way of background, the evidence before me shows that the Applicant arrived in Australia on 20 May 2009 as the holder of a student visa.   He has not departed the country since.  On 20 March 2012, he applied for the student visa in issue in this matter before me.  He was granted a bridging visa.  The application that he made on 20 March 2012 was refused by the Delegate on 10 August 2012; however, the Applicant reviewed that decision before the then Migration Review Tribunal, and on 3 February 2014, that Tribunal remitted the application to the Delegate for further consideration.  On 27 May 2014, the Delegate again refused the application.   The Applicant then took that decision to the Migration Review Tribunal for review and it is from that decision that he now seeks a review before me.  It would seem on the evidence that the decision by the then Migration Review Tribunal was based upon the interpretation of cl.572.223 of Schedule 2 of the Migration Regulations 1994 (Cth), which states, relevantly, that:  “(1) The Minister is satisfied that the applicant is a genuine applicant for entry and stays a student because:  (a) the Minister is satisfied that the applicant intends genuinely to stay in Australia temporarily having regard to:     (i) the applicant’s circumstances; and   (ii) the applicant’s immigration history; and  (iii) if the applicant is a minor--the intentions of a parent, legal guardian or spouse of the applicant; and  (vi) any other relevant matter.”  The Tribunal, in its findings, said this at paragraph 13:  “The tribunal finds that the applicant does not intend to stay in Australia temporarily and is instead using a Student Visa system for the purpose of prolonging his stay.  This is based on the following factors: The applicant entered Australia in May 2009 and has not departed Australia since this time, and this indicates that his long-term aim is to remain in Australia and that his connections to India are not strong as to warrant his return;” Although the Applicant has studied for the majority of his time in Australia, he has repeatedly enrolled in short-term, inexpensive and seemingly unrelated courses.   This indicates to the Tribunal that the Applicant is studying for the sole purpose of remaining in Australia.  Adding weight to this argument is the fact that the Applicant has not been studying since mid-2014 according to his own evidence and only re-enrolled in study one day prior to the hearing (as recorded on the certificate of enrolment submitted by the applicant after the hearing). The Applicant has a child in Australia and this provides a very strong incentive for him to remain in Australia in the long term.   In making this finding, the Tribunal notes the Applicant’s evidence that he is going to obtain full-time care of the child and return with the child to India.   However, as noted by the Tribunal during the hearing, the Applicant has not taken any steps to facilitate this alleged plan of action and the Tribunal finds it both unrealistic and without a set timeframe that the Applicant would successfully pursue such a course of action.  The Tribunal instead finds that the Applicant plans to remain in Australia long-term, at least partly to pursue his relationship with his child, and this indicates that the Applicant is not in Australia temporarily as required by the genuine temporary entrant criteria. 10. As I say, those were the findings of the Tribunal which amount to the Tribunal saying that it was not satisfied.  It is the satisfaction of the Tribunal that is paramount.   As can be seen, in giving their reasons, the Tribunal pointed to three aspects of the evidence by which it cumulatively came to the view that it was not satisfied as to the genuineness of the intention to stay in Australia temporarily. Now, the matter before me has five grounds.  They are:  “Ground 1: The Second Respondent has failed to properly interpret 572.223(1)(a) of the Migration Regulations 1994 which was an error of jurisdiction.   Ground 2: The Second Respondent failed to take relevant considerations into account which was an error of jurisdiction.  Ground 3: The Second Respondent took irrelevant considerations into account which was an error of jurisdiction.  Ground 4: The Second Respondent did not properly apply the law to the facts available and hence failed to properly exercise jurisdiction.  Ground 5: The Second Respondent asked itself the wrong question in determining the application for review which was an error of jurisdiction.” I will look at ground two and three first, because those matters may be more easily dealt with.  With regard to ground two, the Applicant says that:  “The Second Respondent did not take into account the consideration that a person on a Student (Temporary) (Class TU) visa would normally be of limited financial means, and would not have the luxury of travelling back and forth to their home country on a regular basis.  As such, the Second Respondent did not take into account or ask the question whether the Applicant had the financial means to travel to India regularly, or what his reasons were for not travelling back to India during his stay in Australia.  ... The Second Respondent did not take into account that the Migration Regulations 1994 only requires that the Applicant have sufficient funds to cover the travel cost of one return trip to the Applicant’s home country at the end of his or her stay, and not the financial capacity to afford multiple trips.”  Therefore, by failing to take that into account, there was a “jurisdictional error”.  With regard to this aspect, as I have said to the Applicant’s solicitor in the course of argument, I do not see that this in any way amounts to a jurisdictional error.   The merits of whether such a matter should have been taken into account are one thing. It may well be that there are many arguments that could have been mounted on this issue.   It was conceded that this was not something that the Applicant said to the Tribunal and, quite frankly, when I have a look at the evidence, there is nothing which suggests that this is a reason why the Applicant has not gone back to India; that is, because he is somewhat impecunious.  The problem, though, is a far more fundamental one.  As I said at the beginning of these reasons, the question here is whether the Minister is satisfied that the Applicant intends genuinely to stay in Australia. That is, whether, on the whole of the evidence, the Minister has that requisite degree of satisfaction.   What the Applicant is doing with such a ground is not looking at the aspect of the satisfaction of the Minister, but is instead looking at one aspect of the decision and trying to, in some way, impugn that aspect.  Even if the Applicant were successful in impugning that aspect, that does not mean that there has been a jurisdictional error.  If that were to amount to a jurisdictional error, that would mean that a jurisdictional error equates to a merits review.   The aspect here that the Applicant complains of is clearly a merits review and a merits review is not open on a privative clause decision.   There is nothing in that ground that in any way shows to me that the failure to take into account that it may just be that the Applicant did not have enough funds, is enough to say that the satisfaction that was reached by the Tribunal could never have occurred if they were looking at the matter properly, and that is what must be shown for there to be illustrated to me a jurisdictional error.   Therefore ground two fails. Ground Three:  “That the Second Respondent took irrelevant considerations into account which was an error of jurisdiction.” The argument is that the irrelevant consideration was that the “Applicant’s connections to India are not as strong as he has not departed Australia since May 2009” and “that there is no correlation between a person’s ability to travel to their home country on a regular basis and their connection to that home country.”   The argument is that the Tribunal took into account “an irrelevant consideration which led to a jurisdictional error.” The argument was further based on the Tribunal looking at the fact that the Applicant had enrolled in “short-term, inexpensive and seemingly unrelated courses.”  The argument is “that a person’s choice of courses is an irrelevant consideration as the fact that a person is studying means that they are abiding by their Student  (Temporary) (Class TU) visa conditions.”  It was submitted that it was reasonable to conclude that a person on a student visa who enrolled or completed in multiple types of courses wants to increase or enhance their qualifications or skill.   The third aspect of this is that it was an irrelevant consideration that the Applicant had a child here.  It was submitted “that the Applicant as the father of an Australian born child has the right to pursue any legal avenue with regards to custodial or parental arrangements regarding that child.”  Again, in my view, this ground suffers from the same defect that the former ground suffers, and that is that again it is concentrating on factual matters that the Tribunal has looked at and is attempting to impugn those factual findings.   It again is not the question as to whether another conclusion on the facts could have, or even should have, been made.   What has to be shown is that those matters were so out of kilter with common sense, that if one looked at those matters properly, it could not have been open for a reasonable decision-maker to have come to that decision; that the decision maker was satisfied.   The matters with which the Applicant complains could never have had that character.   They are properly characterised as impermissible merit reviews and are not such that one could say that they were jurisdictional errors.  For those reasons, ground three also fails.   That leaves grounds one, four and five and, in many ways, these can be dealt with at the same time.   Ground one is that there was a failure to properly interpret cl.572.223(1)(a).   The argument is that, in regard to those matters that I read out in paragraph 13 of the decision, the Applicant says that such “conclusions were inferred from the interpretation of the term “intends genuinely to stay in Australia temporarily” in clause 572.223(1)(a)...” And the Applicant says that the Tribunal concluded that clause to mean “that a person intends to stay in Australia for a limited time, and will not, or does not, have any intention to stay in Australia long-term.”  Whilst I do not see that that submission is made out, it is quite obvious that what the Applicant is saying is that the proper way in which cl.572.223(1)(a) ought be considered is that the Tribunal must ask itself the question as to whether the Minister is satisfied that the Applicant intends to stay in Australia only during the time for which a subclass 572 visa applied for, will be valid.   The Applicant says that the Tribunal failed to take into account the intention of the legislation when they interpreted cl.572.223(1)(a).    The argument of the Applicant really revolves around the interpretation of a decision of Judge Manousaridis in Khanna & Ors v Minister for Immigration and Anor  [2015] FCCA 1971.  That was a decision handed down by His Honour on 20 July 2015 in Sydney.  In that matter, the Applicant, who was a national of India, entered Australia on a student visa in August of 2009.  That visa was valid until 25 October 2011.   On 13 November 2011 the Applicant applied for a further visa under subclass 573, but that was refused.   A Tribunal had affirmed that decision, and the matter had gone on review to be heard by His Honour.   It seems that there were a number of courses that the Applicant there had been enrolled in, but for a number of reasons many of those courses were never completed.   The Applicant had been enrolled in a bachelor degree in business, but it was submitted that she cancelled that enrolment because she was not sure that she would be granted a visa and did not want to waste money if she had not.   What is noted in the judgment of Judge Manousaridis is that – and this at paragraph 9: The Tribunal’s reasons record the following:   “Later in the hearing the Tribunal asked the applicant what her future intentions were, and the applicant said she would like to stay and make a future and settle [sic] in Australia if given the chance”. In paragraph 10 His Honour noted:  “In response to the Tribunal informing the applicant that on the face of it the applicant’s movements in and out of Australia indicated that her long-term intention was to stay in Australia, the applicant said that “Australia is safe and she would like to settle in Australia in the long term if given the chance”.” The Tribunal in that case was not satisfied that the Applicant had a genuine intention of staying in Australia temporarily.   The Tribunal said its finding was based on several factors, including:  “ a) the applicant’s evidence that she wishes to settle in Australia in the long term if given the opportunity,  b) the applicant’s immigration history which indicated the applicant spent a limited amount of time outside Australia since her arrival,  c) the applicant’s not having a current confirmation of enrolment for a course of study in Australia, and  d) the limited and unconvincing evidence regarding the value of further study in Australia towards the applicant’s long-term future.” The argument before His Honour was that the Tribunal misplaced reliance on the Applicant’s intention to stay permanently in Australia if given the opportunity.  That is because of what I have earlier remarked at paragraph 13(a) of His Honour’s reasons.   His Honour has, in his reasons, said that what needed to be taken into account in relation to this matter is that the Applicant’s intention to settle in Australia did have a qualifier.  That is, she would like to live in Australia if it were an opportunity that she was able to avail herself of, that is, if she was qualified to do so or if she was allowed to do so.   The way in which His Honour dealt with the matter can be seen in his reasons, and I do not plan to go through all of his reasons.   However, it seems to me that what His Honour was saying was that reliance upon what it is that she said to the Tribunal really was not capable of the inference to which the Tribunal seemed to make.   His Honour spoke of the possibility of a person to have an intention to stay in Australia which was an intention that was not inconsistent with the intention that is spoken about in cl.572.223.  His Honour considered that the Tribunal’s reliance upon what it was that she said, without also relying upon the rider that she had made to that intention, was really a matter that the Tribunal ought not to have done.   Now, it has been suggested to me, in this particular matter, by the Minister, that this present case before me is distinguishable from the matter of Khanna (Supra).   I understand that submission for these reasons – that here in this case there was a definite intention mentioned by the Applicant in Khanna (Supra) that is not present in the present case.   His Honour, I should say, in Khanna (Supra) ended up saying this at paragraph 33:  “In my opinion, the Tribunal determined the applicant’s case on the assumption that the applicant’s wish to settle in Australia in the long term, if given the opportunity, implied the applicant did not have an intention to genuinely stay in Australia temporarily.  That is apparent from the Tribunal’s relying on the applicant’s evidence that she wishes to settle in Australia in the long term if given the opportunity.   That, in turn, led the Tribunal to make a jurisdictional error.  The jurisdictional error is that the Tribunal did not in truth undertake the inquiry cl.573.223 required it to undertake, namely, to consider whether the applicant intended to return to her home country at the end of the period for which the Subclass 573 visa she applied for would be valid.” Whilst the Minister says that this matter can be distinguished, the Applicant says that it cannot be distinguished and, unless I were to say that this decision was wrong, that the fact that the Tribunal has not asked itself the question that His Honour says the Tribunal should ask in paragraph 33 of his decision, would amount to a jurisdictional error.   In my view, one has to go back to the words of the clause; that is “... the Minister is satisfied that the applicant intends genuinely to stay in Australia temporarily...”.   To my mind, one has to look at what is it that the Minister has to be satisfied about.  In the explanatory statement which was issued by the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship at the time of the enactment of these clauses the following appears at page 8:  “The amendment requires the Minister to consider the circumstances of the applicant to ascertain whether the applicant genuinely intends to come to Australia, and then return home, following the completion of the primary applicant’s studies.” This is what, in my view, the Minister has to be satisfied of; that the Applicant genuinely intends to come to Australia, study and to return home.   The student visa program is one that is beneficial to Australia in that it is asking students from all over the world to come to our country on a temporary basis, take advantage of our education institutions and facilities and, using that education, to return back to their country, where they can utilise what it is that Australia has been able to teach them for the benefit of their own communities and for their country in general.   In the same way, by doing this, they, the students, benefit and the country from which they come also benefits.   Australia benefits economically by having these students here.  It also enriches our culture and ensures that our educational facilities maintain a standard that is world-class so as to be able not only to attract our own citizens to study but to attract persons from overseas.  As I said in the course of argument, this is a win-win situation for everyone involved.   But it only survives upon the student visa regime not being, to use the vernacular, rorted.  This is what, to my mind, cl.572.223 is talking about when it uses the word “genuinely”; that is, that the person is using the student visa program in the genuine spirit with which it has been set up.   It is for the Minister to be satisfied, having regard to all the evidence, the circumstances of the Applicant, their immigration history and all other relevant matters, that there is a genuine intention to stay in Australia temporarily in the spirit with which this regime is operated.   For this reason, even though I find that there are significant differences in the facts of the matter of Khanna (Supra) and the present matter that would be able to allow me to distinguish the matter of Khanna from the present case, that I am also of the view that the matter of Khanna was decided per incuriam.   The question that the Tribunal had to ask itself is not confined to – “Did the Applicant intend to return to her home country at the end of the period for which the subclass 573 visa would be valid”?  The question the Tribunal had to ask itself is – “Am I satisfied that the applicant intends to come to Australia to study and then to return home?”  It is a question that, in my view, ought not be narrowed any further than that.   To my mind, what was done in Khanna (Supra) was to focus upon what His Honour spoke of in paragraph 13(a) as being the Applicant’s evidence that she wishes to settle in Australia in the long term if given the opportunity.   His Honour was of the view that the Tribunal was, in effect, asking itself the wrong question.   To my mind, even if the Tribunal did ask itself the wrong question, that did not amount to a jurisdictional error.  A jurisdictional error could only have occurred if His Honour took the next step and said that:- “having regard to the Tribunal not being able to rely upon what it was that the Applicant had said, the Tribunal should have looked then at whether: the immigration history, (which indicated she spent a limited time outside of Australia since her arrival) her not having current confirmation of enrolment for a course of study in Australia and  the limited and unconvincing evidence regarding the value of further study in Australia towards the Applicant’s long-term future was sufficient that a reasonable decision-maker could have come to the conclusion that was reached”. In other words, was it open on the evidence, as His Honour then took the evidence, for the conclusion that the Applicant did not genuinely intend to stay in Australia temporarily.   If His Honour was of the view that, on the evidence, such a conclusion was not open, then he would find that that was a jurisdictional error.   By focusing upon this one aspect and concluding that the Tribunal was therefore wrong, did not, to my mind, amount to a jurisdictional error.   I can distinguish the matter of Khanna (Supra) from this particular case simply on the facts.  The Applicant in Khanna (Supra) had said that she did have an intention to stay in Australia if she were allowed, which was not a consideration in the present case. Such a conclusion would be sufficient for me to dispose of the point. However, whilst I can distinguish Khanna (supra), I acknowledge that some may see my doing that as an attempt to try and duck the issue.   It is my view that, even if I could not distinguish the case of Khanna (Supra) from my present one, that I would not follow Khanna (Supra) in any event, because I do not believe that it was decided correctly.   That then brings me to the submissions made in the present case.   The submissions in this case were that Khanna (Supra) is correct and, in effect, because the Tribunal in this case had not asked itself the pertinent question raised in Khanna (Supra), that therefore there is a jurisdictional error.   To my mind, because I have found that Khanna (Supra) is not a correct statement of the law, I need not consider that.   What I can say is this – that on my view of the evidence, when one looks at everything that the Tribunal has done, it has asked itself the proper question.   This is because when I look at the way in which the Tribunal phrased the first sentence in paragraph 13, it said,   “The Tribunal finds that the applicant does not intend to stay in Australia temporarily and is instead using a Student Visa system for the purpose of prolonging his stay...” That is a correct question that the Tribunal must ask itself.  It conforms to, not only cl.572.223, but to that which is contained in the explanatory statement.   I therefore find that grounds one, four and five also fail.   I therefore dismiss the application in this matter.I certify that the preceding ninety-three (93) paragraphs are a true copy of the reasons for judgment of Judge VastaDate: 22 September 2015       ',\n",
       " 'Singh v Minister for Immigration & Anor [2015] FCCA 2836 (23 October 2015)': ' Introduction   The applicant in these proceedings is Baljit Singh “the applicant”.  He seeks orders to quash a decision of the Migration Review Tribunal, as the Administrative Appeals Tribunal was formerly known (hereinafter referred to as “the Tribunal”), which was made on 13 October 2014.  In this decision the Tribunal confirmed an earlier decision of a delegate of the Minister for Immigration & Border Protection not to grant the applicant a Skilled (Provisional) Class VC Visa “the visa” pursuant to the provisions of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) “the Act”.   The applicant is a citizen of India.  He arrived in this country, in September of 2008, pursuant to a student visa issued on 29 July 2008. Between September 2008 and August 2011, the applicant completed a diploma in community welfare, at a private educational institution located in Adelaide.   The application for the relevant visa in these proceedings was ostensibly lodged by the applicant personally on 29 August 2011 via the Department website.  On the electronically generated visa application form, in response to the question did you receive assistance in completing this form, the answer “no” is entered.  In the application form, the applicant purportedly indicated that he wished to be granted the relevant skilled visa, so that he could seek employment as a community worker.  In addition, he indicated that his skills had been assessed by Trades Recognition Australia on 18 January 2010.  On 17 February 2012, a delegate of the Minister wrote to Mr Singh indicating that the Department had information available to it, which indicated that the applicant had assistance from a business known as S & S Migration in his visa application. This business had been found to have previously lodged applications, with the Department, which had been found to contain false and misleading information.   In addition, in departmental correspondence dated 17 February 2012, the applicant was advised that departmental staff had identified a file with the applicant’s personal details and application reference numbers in the office of S & S Migration.  Mr Singh was invited to comment on this information.   The applicant did not respond to this information to provide information.  Thereafter, on 28 May 2012, the Minister’s Delegate declined to grant the skilled 485 visa applied for by the applicant.   The applicant thereafter applied to the Tribunal for a review of this decision.  The legislative provisions relating to the functions of the Tribunal are set out in Division 5 of Part 5 of the Act.   Pursuant to section 359A, the Tribunal is required to provide to any applicant concerned with any information which it considers relevant to the decision under review so that such an applicant may provide comment on it or otherwise respond.  In this particular case, on 16 April 2014, a letter was sent to Mr Singh inviting him to comment on the following matters: Trades Recognition Australia had no record of providing the skills assessment referred to in Mr Singh’s visa application;  Documents and information relating to Mr Singh had been found at the office of S & S Migration, which entity had been found to have lodged misleading and false information with the department.  There is no controversy that the applicant received the section 359A letter requesting information because he responded to it on 8 May 2014.  In his response, he indicated that he had no documents to provide because:  “... S & S migration Agent, Mr Jatinder Singh miss guide and give me the wrong information regarding this visa..., I don’t even know whats (sic) the 457 visa is ...”[1] Pursuant to section 360 the Tribunal is required to invite any applicant to appear before it to give evidence and present arguments relating to the issues in relation to the decision under review. In addition, pursuant to section 360A, such an invitation notice must include the date, time and place at which the applicant concerned is required to appear.   An invitation letter was sent to the applicant, at the address nominated by him, following his filing of a change of contact details, on 2 September 2014.  The invitation letter nominated a date, time and place of hearing as required. The decision of the Tribunal  The applicant did not attend the hearing, at the date and time indicated to him.  As a consequence, pursuant to the provisions of section 362B of the Act, if an applicant, who has been invited to attend before the Tribunal pursuant to section 360, fails to appear on the scheduled time, the Tribunal has a discretion to make a decision on the review issue without taking any further action to allow or enable the applicant to appear before it. On the day and time scheduled for the hearing, at the direction of the presiding member, a Tribunal officer telephoned the applicant on the number provided by him in an attempt to contact him.  However, there was no response to the call.  In these circumstances, the Tribunal determined to finalise the review application pursuant to the power referred to it under section 362B.  The criteria relevant to the grant of the visa are set out in clause 485.224 of schedule 2 to the Migration Regulations 1994.  Essentially, it is an essential pre-condition for the grant of the visa in question that the skills of the applicant in his/her nominated occupation have been assessed by a relevant assessing authority as being suitable for that occupation.  In addition, an applicant for a temporary graduate subclass 485 visa must satisfy a number of public interest criteria, which are set out in Schedule 4 Part 1 of the Regulations.  In particular, pursuant to public interest criterion 4020, there must be no evidence before the Minister or the Tribunal or other assessing authority that information that is false or misleading in a material particular has been supplied in relation to any application for any 485 visa.   However, pursuant to subclause (4) of public interest criterion 4020 this requirement can be waived if there are compassionate or compelling circumstances that affect the interests of an Australian citizen or the interests of Australia itself.   The expression information that is false or misleading in a material particular is defined in public interest criterion 4020(5).  It includes information that is false and misleading at the time it is given and relevant to any of the criteria, which the Minister may consider when making a visa decision.  The Tribunal considered that the application in question contained false and misleading information on the basis that Trades Recognition Australia had no record of providing the skills assessment referred to in it.  In this context, it considered that it was not necessary for it to reach a conclusion that the applicant himself was aware that the information was purposely untrue or was complicit in the provision of the false information.   In this regard, it relied on the decision of the Full Court of the Federal Court in Trivedi & Ors v Minister for Immigration & Border Protection & Anor[2]  In the case Buchanan J said as follows in respect of public interest criterion 4020:  “... it is equally clear that PIC 4020 is directed at the overall integrity of the visa system and as a bulwark against deception and fraught from any quarter associated with a visa applicant.  It is not inconsistent with a coherent public policy to make a visa applicant ultimately responsible for purposely untrue material provided with a visa application.  It would be an intolerable burden on the administration of the visa system to require that those assessing visa applications not only discover that information or documents are false in a material particular, but also that the visa applicant who provided them knew them to be so.  In many cases that would be impossible and would defeat the apparent intent of the provisions.” Accordingly, in the case, the Full Court concluded that the relevant criterion referred to information that was false, in the sense that it was purposely untrue and further that it was not necessary to conclude that a visa applicant was aware that the information was purposely untrue before the criterion was engaged.  The Tribunal also considered the applicant’s correspondence of 8 May 2014, which implicitly suggested that he had no knowledge of the contents of the visa application because it had been completed by Mr Jatinder Singh of S & S Migration.  In this context, the Tribunal made reference to section 98 of the Act, which provides as follows:  “A non-citizen who does not fill in his or her application form or passenger card is taken to do so if he or she causes it be filled in or if it is otherwise filled in on his or her behalf.” In NAWZ v Minister for Immigration & Multicultural & Indigenous Affairs[3] an applicant for refugee status was found to have fraudulently used a pseudonym and claimed to have a nationality different to that which he had.  Later, he asserted that he had not personally signed or filled in the application and therefore it did not satisfy the strict requirements of the Act. The Full Court rejected this contention.  It held that the applicant in question, as a consequence of section 98, was fixed with responsibility for the false document.  As such, the application was found to comply with the provisions of the Act and to be therefore valid.  Rather, it was characterised as a false application which was in formal terms, a valid application.[4] In SZGJO v Minister for Immigration & Multicultural & Indigenous Affairs [5] Bennett J said as follows:  “The applicant authorised and caused his migration agent to fill in the visa application on his behalf.  While he did not specifically authorise the inclusion of incorrect or incomplete information, as in NAWZ, s 98 applies.” In the current case, the Tribunal referred to Prodduturi & Kaur v Minister for Immigration[6] in which it was held that the effect of section 98 is that an applicant is taken to have filled out the application lodged on his or her behalf by an agent and its operation is not subject to any express or implied limitation in circumstances where the visa application is associated with, or the product of, unlawful conduct.  In the current case, the Tribunal found that the applicant was aware that his application had been made.  This followed by his acknowledgement that he had engaged the services of S & S Migration to lodge a visa application on his behalf.   In addition, the Delegate’s decision records indicated that the applicant had contacted the Department seeking the transaction number for his visa application.  On this basis, the Tribunal was satisfied that, through his agent, Mr Singh had either given or caused to be given information, regarding a Trades Recognition assessment skills assessment, which was false and misleading.   In these circumstances, the Tribunal found as follows:  “As a result, the Tribunal is not satisfied that there is no evidence that the applicant has given, or caused to be given, to the Minister, or an officer of the department, the Tribunal or a relevant assessing authority information that is false or misleading in a material particular in relation to his application for a Skilled (Provisional) (Class VC) visa.  Accordingly, the Tribunal finds that the applicant does not meet the requirements of PIC 4020(1).”[7] Thereafter, the Tribunal went on to consider whether the public interest criterion should be waived on the basis of compelling circumstances affecting the interests of Australia or an Australian citizen. In determining this issue, the Tribunal considered both departmental guidelines and case authority.  In particular, Thongpraphai v Minister for Immigration & Multicultural Affairs[8] in which O’Loughlin J considered that the phrase compelling or compassionate called for the occurrence of an event or events that were both far-reaching and most heavily persuasive.   The relevant departmental guidelines made reference to Australia’s trade or business opportunities being adversely affected; the damaging of Australia’s relationship with a foreign government; and finally Australia missing out on a significant benefit that the visa applicant concerned could contribute to Australia’s business, economic, cultural or other development.   In this context, the Tribunal found as follows:  “The Tribunal has considered the fact that according to the visa application form lodged with the Department the applicant has purportedly undertaken and successfully completed studies in community welfare in Australia.  However, there is no evidence to confirm this is, in fact, the case.  Even if the Tribunal proceeds upon the basis that the applicant did complete such studies in Australia, there is little in the evidence to indicate that, as a result of the applicant’s completion of these studies, Australia would miss out on a significant business, economic, cultural or other benefit if he was not granted a subclass 485 visa to remain in Australia.  Consequently, given all the evidence before it, the Tribunal is not satisfied that these matters constitute compelling circumstances affecting the interests of Australia that would justify the grant of a subclass 485 visa to the applicant : paragraph 4020(4)(a).”[9] In addition, the Tribunal noted that the applicant had not identified any Australian or New Zealand citizen or Australian permanent resident whose interest would be affected if he were not granted the 485 visa in question.  The Tribunal noted that the focus of paragraph 4020(4)(b) was not on any circumstances that might affect the applicant personally. Finally, notwithstanding the matters surrounding the provision of misleading information and whether the applicant did or did not know of it, the Tribunal found that, in any event, the applicant had not satisfied the essential precondition for the grant of the visa in that he had provided no proof that his skills had been assessed as suitable by a relevant assessing authority.  This was notwithstanding the invitation, proffered to him, pursuant to section 359A, to provide such information, notwithstanding the bogus nature of the initial skills recognition number.   In these circumstances, the Tribunal made the following finding of fact, on the basis of the evidence available to it:  “On the evidence available, the Tribunal finds that the applicant nominated the occupation of Community Worker which is a specified skilled occupation.  For that occupation, the relevant assessing authority specified is TRA.  After considering the information on the Department’s file that TRA had no record of supplying the applicant with a skills assessment, and in the absence of any other evidence from the applicant, the Tribunal is not satisfied that the applicant’s skill have been assessed as suitable for his nominated skilled occupation by the relevant assessing authority.  The applicant therefore does not satisfy the requirements of cl.485.221(1) and, if follows, cl.485.221 as a whole.”[10] The legal provisions applicable   Pursuant to section 476(1) of the Migration Act, the Federal Circuit Court has “the same original jurisdiction in relation to migration decisions as the High Court under section 75(v) of the Constitution”. However, this jurisdiction is qualified by section 474 of the Act, which stipulates that a wide variety of decisions made under the Act, which are of an administrative nature are “privative clause decisions”. The decision of the MRT, which the applicant seeks to review in this case is such a “privative clause decision” as defined by section 474 of the Act.   Pursuant to the section, privative clause decisions are final and conclusive and as such are not open to being challenged, appeal against, reviewed, quashed or called in question in any court and as a consequence, they are not to be subject to any prerogative writ.   However, the High Court has held that the provisions of section 474 do not prevent the review of decisions made by the Tribunal, which are affected by jurisdictional error of have been made in bad faith.[11] An administrative tribunal exceeds its powers and thus commits a jurisdictional error if it identifies a wrong issue; asks a wrong question; ignores relevant material; relies on irrelevant material; or, in some circumstances, makes an erroneous finding or reaches a mistaken conclusion, in a way that affects the exercise or purported exercise of the tribunal’s power.[12] Jurisdictional error is a complex concept.  It does not entail a merits review or a re-hearing of the facts of the case concerned.  In addition to the matters listed above, it can also encompass a breach of procedural fairness or a denial of natural justice, including bias or the appearance of bias. Conclusions  I do not accept that the applicant has demonstrated any jurisdictional error in the determination reached by the Tribunal.  In my view, the Tribunal fairly dealt with the visa application before it, including the issues surrounding the applicant’s allegation that he knew nothing of the actions of the fraudulent migration agent.   In my view, it was open to the Tribunal to conclude that the application was vitiated by the provision of fraudulent information.  However, more significantly, the Tribunal was right to conclude that there was no evidence whatsoever that the applicant had undergone the required assessment of his skills, as required by the applicable visa application condition. This was notwithstanding the fact that the applicant had been requested to provide such information on several occasions and had also been invited to appear before the Tribunal itself, an invitation which he declined to take up.  There being no discernible legal error, the application must be dismissed.  The first respondent seeks costs in the sum of $6,825.00.  In this case, I accept that costs should follow the result.  Given the abolition of the Migration Review Tribunal, I will make an order that the second respondent be replaced with the Administrative Appeals Tribunal.  For all these reasons, the orders of the court will be as set out at the commencement of these reasons for judgment.

       " 'Singh v Minister for Immigration & Anor [2015] FCCA 3331 (18 December 2015)': '  This matter involves a challenge to a decision by the Migration Review Tribunal (“the Tribunal”), which was made on 6th November 2014.  It concerns the Applicant’s competency in English and whether or not there has been compliance with and satisfaction of one particular part of the labyrinthine Migration Regulations 1994 (“the Regulations”).   As other judges have observed, to enter the world of the Regulations, as with much other federal legislation, is to enter a parallel universe.  For lawyers to seek to comprehend them is a difficult enough exercise.  How any Applicant has either the wherewithal and/or the capacity to wend through such a minefield, let alone remotely to comprehend them, could, in some respects, be regarded as cruel and unusual punishment. Be that as it may, the matter before the Court specifically concerns, amongst other things, whether or not there has been compliance with Regulation 1.15C.  More particularly, the issue for determination is whether there has been compliance with the requirement that there has been an IELTS (international English language test system) test done in the two years immediately before the day on which the Application was made.   The Applicant here claimed in his Application filed on 26th June 2012 that he had completed an IELTS test on 22nd June 2012 and was found to reach a level of being “competent”. Although requested on a number of occasions to provide evidence of that test result, no evidence has ever been provided of that IELTS test dated 22nd June 2012.  Indeed, on 3rd December 2012, the Applicant was requested by the Department to provide evidence of that test and given a further 28 days within which to provide it.  This request has never been answered.   It is the case that at pages 113 - 118 of the Court Book (“CB”) there is evidence of the IELTS tests for the Applicant over a period of time in 2014.  There is also the curious but still difficult document, being the General Skilled Migration Application Form, which contains the following “important note” at page 10.[1]  The note says (emphasis added):  You have up until the time of decision to provide evidence that you have competent English.  However, Applicants should not delay in providing their evidence of English language ability.  The department will not delay finalising applications where English language test results have not been provided at time of application.  Applicants will have 28 days from the date of application to provide their English language results if they did not provide them at the time of application.  At this point in time if evidence has not been provided the application may be refused. I have highlighted a number of inconsistencies; the relevant forms, not to mention the Regulations themselves, could have been written by script-writers for the ABC TV series Utopia.  To highlight the inconsistencies again: at the outset of the notation it refers to “up until the time of decision to provide evidence that you have competent English”.  Later it refers to providing English language test results “at time of application.”  Later still in the same notation it says that Applicants will have 28 days from the date of application to provide their English language results if they did not provide them at the time of application.  Respectfully, on many levels, this is a less than helpful and otherwise highly confusing notation. In the course of the hearing on 15th April 2015, I pointed out to the lawyers acting for both parties (a) my concerns about the notation to which I have referred and (b) in my view, notwithstanding the obscure and confusing wording in the form, a number of Federal Court decisions (noted below) made it almost impossible for the Application to succeed.     The decisions which, in my view, stand in the way of the current Application succeeding are: Parmar v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Singh v Minister for Immigration and Border Protection, and Sidhu v Minister for Immigration and Border Protection.[2]  The Minister submitted that the latter two decisions, by themselves, prevented the application from succeeding.    The Applicant’s Submissions  In general terms, the Grounds of Review (which also contain abbreviated submissions) may be grouped into three parts:  (a) Excepting grounds 1 and 2 (noted further below), grounds 3 and 4 seek to rely upon s.353 of the Migration Act 1958 (“the Act”) regarding the requirement for the Tribunal to act without being bound by (among other things) technicalities and legal forms, which ought to result in a decision that is different from the Tribunal’s actual decision, otherwise the decision (it was said) is not “fair”. (b) The ‘date of decision’ versus the ‘date of application’ “structure” in the Act “is unlawful and should be struck out”.  It is “unworkable.” (c) Grounds 6 and 7 contend that the IELTS score is discriminatory “against individuals from non-English speaking backgrounds”; and the decision of the High Court in Berenguel v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship “is good law”, and subsequent amendments to the Regulations “did not have the effect of rendering the decision void.” The submissions in support of these grounds of review may be summarised as follows. Firstly, the Applicant relied upon the High Court decision in Berenguel v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, in which (so it was contended) the High Court described the application of the regulations then relevant as “capricious and unjust.”[3]  This led the Applicant in this case to submit that even though the legislature has changed the Regulations to require the Applicant to have a satisfactory IELTS score as at the date of the application, this of itself does not mean that the High Court has changed its mind about the Regulations being inherently unjust.[4] Further, the Applicant argued that on the basis of Berenguel an Applicant who provides evidence of having satisfied the IELTS requirements under the Migration Regulations, and notwithstanding that this occurs outside of the time prescribed, is entitled to have those IELTS results recognised and, therefore, the application granted.   In subsequent submissions, the principal point made by the Applicant was that:  While there may be a regulation which purports to prohibit the provision of IELTS results after the date of the application, the regulation itself cannot override the clear statutory intention of section 55 of the Migration Act to allow the later provision of such information. The Applicant submitted that the Minister encourages the provision of information after the date of the application and before the date of decision.  This then led to the submission that the Minister in this case should have allowed the Applicant to provide the IELTS test results even if they were lodged after the date of the application.   The Minister’s Submissions  The Minister submitted as follows in the original submissions. Clause 885.213 of Schedule 2 of the Regulations requires that test results, to establish “competent English”, must be satisfied “at the time of the Application.”   This requirement is satisfied, pursuant to Regulation 1.15C, subparagraph (1), if the person satisfies the Minister that (a) the person undertook a language test specified by the Minister in an instrument in writing for this paragraph, (b) the test was conducted in the two years immediately before the day on which the application was made, and (c) the person achieved a score specified in the instrument.[5]  The Applicant’s IELTS report forms are at CB 113-118. The Minister noted that Ground 1 of the Application to Review simply restates the Tribunal’s decision.  Accordingly, there is no relevant ground of review.  I agree. Ground 2 is the Applicant’s interpretation of s.353 of the Act (regarding the Tribunal’s way of operating).  As such, it was submitted that it too was not an appropriate ground of review.  Again I agree. Grounds 3 and 4 of the Application contend that had proper regard been paid to s.353, and similarly to the High Court decision in Minister for Immigration and Border Protection v Li, a different result for the Applicant would have ensued.[6] The Minister contended that there is no evidence that the Tribunal did not comply with s.353 of the Act.  I accept this submission.   Moreover, unfortunately it has become something of a practice of the lawyer who acts for the Applicant (and who appears regularly in this Court) to make general and quite broad statements which are not supported by the actual rulings and comments, in this instance, by the High Court in Li’s case.  The same is true in relation to the same lawyer’s consistent reference to the High Court’s comments in Berenguel.  Broad, generalised statements, unsupported by the decisions cited, are at least unhelpful, at worst, they are potentially misleading.  Such submissions should not be made. The Minister also noted that recent authority confirmed that it is not possible to rely upon IELTS tests that were undertaken after the application was lodged.[7] Further, in answer to a question put to the parties by the Court (and not formally raised by the Applicant) regarding whether the application form itself was or could be misleading, the Minister noted in later written submissions that such an issue was dealt with by Beach J in Kumar v Minister for Immigration and Border Protection.[8]  I accept this submission.  It is sufficient to note the following from his Honour’s decision, beginning at [40] (internal citations omitted):  [40] Mr Kumar asserts that he was misled by the form of the visa application into thinking that he could rely upon test results after the filing of the application. There are a number of answers to this.  [41] First, it is unclear as to whether evidence to this effect was led before the Tribunal. Moreover, there is no evidence to this effect which was led before the Federal Circuit Court or indeed myself.  [42] Second, the form was not misleading. It referred to evidence being filed later rather than a test being taken later. Moreover, there was a question specifically directed to prior tests which Mr Kumar answered.  [43] Third, even if he was misled, that does not alter the relevant criterion that had to be satisfied or the Tribunal’s task under s 65 of the Act. There was no dispute that the criterion had not been satisfied. Moreover, the form of the application could not rewrite the statutory criterion which the Tribunal was bound to consider and apply.  [44] Generally, the appellants’ arguments concerning the asserted misleading nature of the form of application and the assertion that the form may be used to support an argument to rewrite the criterion have been considered and rejected in other cases....  And, as I say, even if Mr Kumar was misled, nevertheless if the criterion was not satisfied, the Tribunal was bound to refuse the visa. Consideration & Disposition  Pursuant to the Regulations, an IELTS test must record a score of at least six for each of the four test components of speaking, reading, writing and listening, and an occupational English test (OET), with a score of at least B in each of the four components.   As already noted, on 26th June 2012, Mr Singh applied for a skilled visa.  In his Application form, it was stated in relation to the provision of evidence of competent English, that he will:  Have up until the time of decision to provide evidence that you have competent English and that Applicants will have 28 days from the date of application to provide their English language results if they did not provide them at time of application.  I have also previously noted that on 3rd December 2013, the Department wrote to Mr Singh requesting further information regarding evidence of his IELTS test certificate.  He was given a further 28 days to respond to this request for further information.  No response was provided.   On 31st March 2014, a delegate of the Minister refused to grant Mr Singh’s visa application.  In doing so, the delegate found that Mr Singh did not satisfy the requirements of clause 885.213 of schedule 2 of the Migration Regulations - the requirement that Mr Singh have “competent English.”   On 6th November 2014, the Tribunal determined to affirm the decision not to grant Mr Singh a Skilled (Residence) (Class VB) visa.  In its decision, the Tribunal noted Mr Singh’s evidence for the results of six IELTS tests.  The Tribunal recorded that the only test which resulted in a score of at least six on all four components was a test result dated 19th July 2014.   Mr Singh claims that he has been in Australia for eight years and spoke English well, that he had successfully completed a number of courses in both Australia and India which were conducted in English, and that he had positive skills assessment from Trades Recognition Australia in respect of his work in Australia.   In the Court Book, there are a range of certificates provided by Mr Singh in relation to a range of courses that he has attended and passed successfully, namely, from the Technical Institute of Victoria.[9]  The Tribunal noted that in accordance with the English proficiency definitions made on 1st July 2011, it was incumbent upon him to demonstrate competent English via an English test, which must be conducted in the two years immediately before the day on which the application is made, and that these amendments were in response to the Berenguel decision of the High Court, to which I have earlier referred.   At the relevant date, the Tribunal found that Mr Singh did not have competent English as defined in regulation 1.15C(a) of the Regulations.  Accordingly, Mr Singh did not satisfy the requirements of clause 885.213 of schedule 2 to the Regulations and, therefore, did not satisfy the criteria for the grant of a subclass 885 visa.  Other than submitting that grounds 1 and 2 in the Application should be dismissed because there is no relevant ground of review formally raised, as I read the Minister’s submissions, the principal matters that are dealt with relate to whether or not the High Court’s decision in Berenguel is still good law in the light of the amendments to the regulations, and more so in the light of various decisions of this Court and the Federal Court. The submissions contend further that there are no grounds upon which the Applicant has relevantly satisfied the Regulations. I have already commented that I accept the Minister’s submissions. In my view, the decisions of the Federal Court in Parmar, Sidu and in Kumar all stand directly in the way of the success of the Application.   For current purposes, I simply note the following from the decision of Perram J in Parmar.  First, in relation to context, his Honour noted, at [1] – [2]:  [1] Until 1958 there remained on the statute books of Australia a law which prevented entry into the country of persons who ‘when an officer dictates to him not less than fifty words in any prescribed language, fails to write them out in that language in the presence of the officer’ (s 3(a) Immigration Restriction Act 1901 (Cth)). No languages were prescribed but another provision in the Act – s 5 – deemed any European language to be a prescribed language. Those administering that Act were equipped thereby with the discretion to ask any immigrant, regardless of origin or tongue, to take a dictation test in any European language whatsoever. The test concealed the unwholesome assumption that any potential immigrant needed to be able to speak every European language. In its practical operation, this law effectively provided for the exclusion from this country of any person whom an officer decided should be excluded for the class of person with a mastery of every European language is small, even in Australia. In practice, as Evatt J observed in The King v Davey; Ex parte Freer  [1936] HCA 58;  (1936) 56 CLR 381 at 386, the test had originally served as ‘a convenient and polite device (which had previously been used similarly in the Colony of Natal) for the purpose of enabling the Executive Government of Australia to prevent the immigration of persons deemed unsuitable because of their Asiatic or non-European race’. In time its utility expanded to include not just the administration of an overtly racist immigration policy but also to hinder the ingress of those thought politically undesirable. The well-known case of Egon Kisch, suspected by the Menzies government of being a communist sympathiser but fluent in many European languages, provides an example of the law in action albeit one where its limits were ultimately reached. Kisch was detained at Circular Quay on the steamship Strathaird following attempts by the Commonwealth to keep him on that vessel as a national security risk. In habeas corpus proceedings against the vessel’s captain Evatt J ordered Kisch’s release on the basis, in substance, that the national security risk was elusive (R v Carter; Ex parte Kisch  [1934] HCA 50;  (1934) 52 CLR 221. Upon his disembarkation from the S.S. Strathaird, Kisch, who was something of a polyglot, was taken to the Central Police Station where he was required to take the dictation test in Scottish Gaelic, a language which according to the report in the High Court was then exclusively spoken by only 6,000 people resident in the northern and western parts of Scotland as well as the western islands. The High Court concluded by majority that Scottish Gaelic was not a European language within the meaning of the Act: R v Wilson; Ex parte Kisch (1934)  [1934] HCA 63;  52 CLR 234. Mr Kisch achieved entry.   [2] Experiences such as these have led to a natural caution in the legal mind about the use of language tests in an immigration setting. On the other hand, there is no doubt that proficiency in the predominant language of any country is a legitimate concern of those charged with the administration of its immigration system. I will record at the outset, therefore, that the language tests with which this appeal is concerned are neither capricious nor a discreet tool for the implementation of concealed policies. To the contrary, the test process under challenge is rational. Then, in response to various arguments, which included (as in the current matter) reliance upon the High Court decision in Berenguel, Perram J said, at [18] and [19]:  [18] It is tolerably clear that the meaning of ‘competent English’ in reg 1.15C is the same as it is in the criteria set out for the visa in cll 485.215 and 485.222. As a matter of ordinary construction one would approach the interpretation of the Regulations on the basis that the expression ‘competent English’ has a uniform meaning throughout the Regulations unless the context otherwise demanded: Queensland v Forest  [2008] FCAFC 96;  (2008) 168 FCR 532 at 540-541 per Black CJ applying the well-known statement of Hodges J in Craig, Williamson Pty Ltd v Barrowcliff  [1915] VicLawRp 66;  [1915] VLR 450 at 452. In this case, the context does not demand that it be given different meanings in those different places. To the contrary, it is clear that cll 485.215 and 485.222 and reg 1.15C travel together as a package of provisions dealing with the position of skilled occupation visas. As such, I do not accept that it is open to read ‘competent English’ in the criteria as meaning ‘competent English or competent English as defined’. Nor is it possible to approach the matter so as to say that the definition in reg 1.15C is not exhaustive. The opening words of the definition – ‘If a person applies for a General Skilled Migration visa, the person has competent English if the person satisfies the Minister that the person [achieves certain results]’ – does not textually lend itself to a non-exhaustive interpretation. The provision is in a familiar form in which a state of affairs is made conditional on the state of mind of a Minister. If it is read non-exhaustively then its legal operation becomes radically different. No longer is the question whether the Minister is satisfied the criteria have been met. Instead, ‘competent English’ becomes a legal standard to be determined by a Court. I do not think that such a profoundly different operation of the regulation is a plausible interpretation of it.   [19] There is, therefore, lacking the grammatical foothold which permitted the High Court in Berenguel to approach the construction issue in the manner that it did. When dealing with the second issue below I conclude that the requirements of reg 1.15C are rational and proportionate. That conclusion provides an additional reason for distinguishing Berenguel in the construction of reg 1.15C which I favour does not promote, as the proposed construction in Berenguel did, the vice of absurdity. In those circumstances, I do not accept that reg 1.15C could be satisfied merely because this Court thought that Mr Parmar could speak competent English or through some other means outside those exhaustively stated in that regulation. After discussing the “rationality” or otherwise of Regulation 1.15C, at [28], his Honour said:  There are additional, broader, issues too. The visas in question are high volume visas for which the number of applications is very large. There needs to be not only a way of testing the language skills of applicants which is suitable to be applied to the large number of applications made but, just as importantly, that system needs to be reliably uniform in its application. The imposition of precise score requirements rationally serves this end. In such a system there will always be those who fall close to the line but that is to be seen as the price to be paid for certainty, efficiency and the species of fairness constituted by consistency. In those circumstances, the challenge to reg 1.15C based on the IELTS website fails, however harsh or frustrating this appears in Mr Parmar’s case. Respectfully, Perram J’s comments apply equally here.  In addition to the Minister’s submissions (which I accept in their entirety), his Honour’s remarks are, in my view, also more than sufficient to require the Court to dismiss the current Application. An order for costs in accordance with the schedule of this Court’s rules must follow.  The Court so orders.I certify that the preceding forty-one (41) paragraphs are a true copy of the reasons for judgment of Judge NevilleAssociate:  Date:  18th December 2015 [1] The skilled migration application form is at CB 1.

       " 'Singh v Minister for Immigration & Border Protection & Anor [2015] FCCA 2654 (25 September 2015)': '  The first respondent seeks an order pursuant to r.13.03C(1)(c) of the Federal Circuit Rules 2001 (Cth) (“the Rules”) that the proceeding before this Court, commenced by way of application filed on 6 May 2014, be dismissed by reason of the failure of the applicant to appear at today’s scheduled hearing. On 2 June 2014, the applicant attended a directions hearing before me, where he had the assistance of a Punjabi interpreter. I explained to the applicant that this Court has no power to interfere with the decision of the Migration Review Tribunal (“the MRT”), unless the Court is satisfied that the MRT’s decision is affected by a mistake going to the jurisdiction of the MRT. At the directions hearing, the applicant was provided with a copy of the applicable costs schedule of the Court and I explained to the applicant the consequences that would flow to him if a costs order was made against him. Namely, that whilst any costs order remains unpaid, it becomes a debt to the Commonwealth of Australia. As such, the applicant’s ability to obtain any other type of visa or re-enter Australia may be significantly affected.  The applicant confirmed that he wished to continue with the application for judicial review. The applicant was given leave to file and serve an Amended Application giving complete particulars of each ground of review relied upon, together with any further evidence by way of affidavit, including any transcript of the MRT hearing, as well as submissions in support by 28 July 2014 and was directed to file and serve written submissions in support of his application 14 days before the hearing.  On that occasion, the matter was set down for hearing for 10 September 2015 at 10:15am, before me. The Orders made on that day also included an Order that in the event there is no appearance by or on behalf of the applicant at the time of any scheduled court event, the application may be dismissed without further notice.  On 8 September 2015, my Chambers wrote to both parties at their addresses for service in Australia informing them that the hearing on 10 September 2015 was vacated and that a new hearing date would be communicated to the parties.  On 14 September 2015, a further letter was sent to the parties at their addresses for service in Australia, notifying the parties that the hearing date was today, 25 September 2015, at 10:00am and providing the location and address of the courtroom. In support of the application for dismissal pursuant to r.13.03C(1)(c) of the Rules, the solicitor for the first respondent, Ms Griffin, tendered a letter dated 2 September 2015 addressed to the applicant at the applicant’s address for service in Australia. That letter was marked Exhibit 1R. Exhibit 1R attached the first respondent’s submissions, filed on 2 September 2015, and notified the applicant that, if the applicant failed to appear at the scheduled court date, the first respondent may seek to dismiss the application. The matter has been called outside on at least two occasions this morning, most recently within the last 10 minutes.  Other than his originating application and supporting affidavit, there has been no document filed by the applicant in this proceeding, either in accordance with the directions of the Court made on 2 June 2014 or at any other time.  Further, there has been no communication received, either by the Court or the first respondent, from the applicant seeking an adjournment of today’s hearing or for any other reason.  In the circumstances, I am satisfied that the applicant is aware of today’s scheduled hearing and, for whatever reason, has chosen not to attend.  I am satisfied that the Orders sought by the first respondent are appropriate.  Accordingly, the proceeding before this Court, commenced by way of application filed on 6 May 2014, should be dismissed with costs pursuant to r.13.03C(1)(c) of the Rules by reason of the failure of the applicant to appear at today’s scheduled hearing.

       " 'Snyman & Anor v Minister for Immigration & Anor [2015] FCCA 2791 (19 October 2015)': '  This is an application for a Constitutional writ in respect of a decision of the Tribunal made on 12 May 2015 affirming a decision of the delegate not to grant the applicant a Business Skilled (Residence) Class DF visa.  In the application initially lodged the first applicant contended that he had net assets that met the requirements for the grant of the visa through a corporate entity, Cutman Pty Ltd, being a 50 percent shareholder in that entity and the other shareholder being his son. The first applicant identified that that entity carried on four different business activities, one being Christof\\'s Hair Salon, now known as Styleworx, providing hairdressing services, the second being Vortik Fusion carrying on a business of supplying alcohol, the third being Status Engine Monitoring Systems which provided certain equipment in relation to monitoring systems, and the fourth being Fitzsimmons Meats, being a butcher\\'s business.   All four business activities were conducted through and operated by the same entity albeit, for the purpose of the requirements under the regulations one of the enterprises, being Fitzsimmons Meats, only commenced its activity approximately six months before the application for the visa.  The corporate entity prepared consolidated accounts for the four businesses it was running, all using the same ABN in respect of which the corporate entity lodged its BAS on the basis of the consolidated businesses.   The first applicant initially contended however that two of the business activities or enterprises, being Status Engine Monitoring Systems and Fitzsimmons Meats, operated by the corporate entity met the requirements of the regulations.  However, due to the position of Fitzsimmons Meats only having been acquired six months before the application this enterprise could not satisfy the regulatory criteria. The value of Status Engine Monitoring Systems alone was insufficient to meet the statutory requirements.  The first applicant contended before the delegate that the corporate entity conducted a main business as reflected by the consolidated accounts and that this was a main business which met the regulatory requirements.   The grounds of the amended application are as follows:  1. The Tribunal misinterpreted the applicable law; and or misapplied the law to the facts; and or took into account an irrelevant consideration  Particulars  (i) The Applicants lodged an application for a Business Skills (Residence) (Class OF) subclass 892 visa application on 2 January 2014 (\\'the visa application\\'). A delegate of the First Respondent refused the visa application and the Applicants sought review at the Tribunal. The Tribunal affirmed the delegate\\'s decision on 12 May 2015.  (ii) The Tribunal found that the First Applicant did not satisfy subclause 892.212(c) of Schedule 2 of the Migration Regulations 1994 (\\'the regulations\\'). Subclause 892.212(c) relevantly provided:  892.212  Unless the appropriate regional authority has determined that there are exceptional circumstances, the applicant meets at least 2 of the following requirements:  (c) the assets owned by the applicant, the applicant\\'s spouse or de facto partner, or the applicant and his or her spouse or de facto partner together, in the main business or main businesses in Australia:  (i) have a net value of at least AUD75 000; and  (ii) had a net value of at least AUD75 000 throughout the period of 12 months ending immediately before the application is made; and  (iii) have been lawfully acquired by the applicant, the applicant\\'s spouse or de facto partner, or the applicant and his or her spouse or de facto partner together.  (iii) The First Applicant relied on his ownership interest in a company, Cutman Pty Ltd (\\'Cutman\\'), as the main business for the purposes of meeting subclause 892.212(c). Cutman operated as a hairdresser (trading name of Styleworx), a butchery (trading name of Fitzsimmons), an importer and manufacturer (trading name of Status Engine Monitoring Systems) and an alcoholic beverages retailer and wholesaler (trading name of Vortik Fusion). Styleworx, Fitzsimmons, Status Engine Monitoring Systems and Vortik Fusion all used one ABN, being that assigned to Gutman.  (iv) For the purposes of subclause 892.212(c), r1 .11 provided:  r1.11  Main business  (1) For the purposes of these Regulations and subject to subregulation (2), a business is a main business in relation to an applicant for a visa if:  (a) the applicant has, or has had, an ownership interest in the business; and   (b) the applicant maintains, or has maintained, direct and continuous involvement in management of the business from day to day and in making decisions affecting the overall direction and perfo1mance of the business; and  (c) the value of the applicant\\'s ownership interest, or the total value of the ownership interests of the applicant and the applicant\\'s spouse or de facto partner, in the business is or was:  (i) if the business is operated by a publicly listed company-at least 10% of the total value of the business; or  (ii) if:  (A) the business is not operated by a publicly listed company; and  (B) the annual turnover of the business is at least AUD400 000;  at least 30% of the total value of the business; or  (iii) if:  (A) the business is not operated by a publicly listed company; and  (B) the annual turnover of the business is less than AUD400 000;  at least 51 % of the total value of the business; and  (d) the business is a qualifying business.  (2) If an applicant has, or has had, an ownership interest in more than 1 qualifying business that would, except for this subregulation, be a main business in relation to the applicant, the applicant must not nominate more than 2 of those qualifying businesses as main businesses.  (v) In seeking to meet subclause 892.212(c), the effect of r1.11 (2) is that an applicant must not nominate more than two qualifying businesses as main businesses. Regulation 1.03 provided:  r1.03  qualifying business means an enterprise that:  (a) is operated for the purpose of making profit through the provision of goods, services or goods and services (other than the provision of rental property) to the public; and  (b) is not operated primarily or substantially for the purpose of speculative or passive investment.  (vi) The First Applicant sought to rely on Cutman, as an enterprise operating as Styleworx, Fitzsimmons, Status Engine Monitoring Systems and Vortik Fusion, under the one ABN, as being one main business.  (vii) The Tribunal, after referring to the ASIC website and the Australian Business Register, formed the opinion that Cutman was not one main business; and that Styleworx, Fitzsimmons, Status Engine Monitoring Systems and Vortik Fusion were each separate main businesses for the purposes of r1.11. Once the Tribunal found that Styleworx, Fitzsimmons, Status Engine Monitoring Systems and Vortik Fusion were each separate main businesses, it considered them as such against subclause 892.212(c) and found the First Applicant did not satisfy that subclause, such that clause 892.212 was not satisfied.  (viii) The Tribunal committed jurisdictional error:  (a) by finding that Cutman (operating as Styleworx, Fitzsimmons, Status Engine Monitoring Systems and Vortik Fusion) was not one main business; and or  (b) by finding Styleworx, Fitzsimmons, Status Engine Monitoring Systems and Vortik Fusion was not collectively one undertaking or enterprise in which the First Applicant had an ownership interest via his shareholding in Cutman, and relevant for the purposes of the \\'main business\\' criterion referred to in subclause 892.212(c); and or   (c) by relying on information relating to businesses on the ASIC website and the Australian Business Register to exclude the possibility that Styleworx, Fitzsimmons, Status Engine Monitoring Systems and Vortik Fusion was one enterprise in which the First Applicant had an ownership interest via his shareholding in Cutman, when that information was not relevant to the \\'main business\\' finding required by subclause 892.212(c); and   (d) by finding that subclause 892.212(c) was not satisfied. Subclause 892.212(c) of the Migration Regulations 1994 relevantly provides:  892.212     Unless the appropriate regional authority has determined that there are exceptional circumstances, the applicant meets at least 2 of the following requirements:   (a)  in the peri od of 12 months ending immediately before the application is made, the main business in Australia, or main businesses in Australia, of the applicant, the applicant\\'s spouse or de facto partner, or the applicant and his or her spouse or de facto partner together:   (i)  provided an employee, or employees, with a total number of hours of employment at least equivalent to the total number of hours that would have been worked by 1 full-time employee over that period of 12 months; and   (ii)  provided those hours of employment to an employee, or employees, who:   (A)  were not the applicant or a member of the family unit of the applicant; and   (B)  were Australian citizens, Australian permanent residents or New Zealand passport holders;   (b)  the business and personal assets in Australia of the applicant, the applicant\\'s spouse or de facto partner, or the applicant and his or her spouse or de facto partner together:   (i)  have a net value of at least AUD250 000; and   (ii)  had a net value of at least AUD250 000 throughout the period of 12 months ending immediately before the application is made; and   (iii)  have been lawfully acquired by the applicant, the applicant\\'s spouse or de facto partner, or the applicant and his or her spouse or de facto partner together;   (c)  the assets owned by the applicant, the applicant\\'s spouse or de facto partner, or the applicant and his or her spouse or de facto partner together, in the main business or main businesses in Australia:   (i)  have a net value of at least AUD75 000; and   (ii)  had a net value of at least AUD75 000 throughout the period of 12 months ending immediately before the application is made; and   (iii)  have been lawfully acquired by the applicant, the applicant\\'s spouse or de facto partner, or the applicant and his or her spouse or de facto partner together. Regulation 1.11 defines \"main business\" as follows:  \\'main business\\' is defined in r.1.11:  1.11 (1) For the purposes of these Regulations and subject to subregulation (2), a business is a main business in relation to an applicant for a visa if:  (a) the applicant has, or has had, an ownership interest in the business; and  (b) the applicant maintains, or has maintained, direct and continuous involvement in management of the business from day to day and in making decisions affecting the overall direction and performance of the business; and  (c) the value of the applicant\\'s ownership interest, or the total value of the ownership interests of the applicant and the applicant\\'s spouse or de facto partner, in the business is or was:  (i) if the business is operated by a publicly listed company - at least 10% of the total value of the business; or  (ii) if:  (A) the business is not operated by a publicly listed company; and  (B) the annual turnover of the business is at least AUD 400000;  at least 30% of the total value of the business; or  (iii) if:  (A) the business is not operated by a publicly listed company;  and  (B) the annual turnover of the business is less than AUD 400000;  at least 51 % of the total value of the business; and   (d) the business is a qualifying business.  (2) If an applicant has, or has had, an ownership interest in more than I qualifying business that would, except for this subregulation, be a main business in relation to the applicant, the applicant must not nominate more than 2 of those qualifying businesses as main businesses. \"Qualifying business\" is defined in reg.1.03 as follows:  \\'qualifying business\\' is defined in r.1.03:  qualifying business means an enterprise that:  (a) is operated for the purpose of making profit through the provision of goods, services or goods and services Cather than the provision of rental property) to the public; and  (b) is not operated primarily or substantially for the purpose of speculative or passive investment. \"Ownership interest\" is defined in reg.1.03 and s.134(10) as follows:  \\'ownership interest\\' is defined r.1.03 and s.134(10):  \"ownership interest\" in relation to a business, means an interest in the business as:  (a) a shareholder in a company that carries on the business; or  (b) a partner in a partnership that carries on the business; or  (c) the sole proprietor of the business;  including such an interest held indirectly through one or more interposed companies, partnerships or trusts; Clause 892.211 provides:  890.211 (1) The applicant has had, and continues to have, an ownership interest in 1 or more actively operating main businesses in Australia for at least 2 years immediately before the application is made.  (2) For each business to which subclause (i) applies:  (a) an Australian Business Number has been obtained; and  (b) all Business Activity Statements required by the Australian Taxation Office (the ATO) for the period mentioned in subclause (1) have been submitted to the ATO and have been included in the application In Nassif v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCA 481;  (2003) 129 FCR 448 at  [455] the Court said:  31 In Re Australian Industrial Relations Commission; Ex parte Australian Transport Officers Federation [1990] HCA 52;  (1990) 171 CLR 216 at 226 Mason CJ, Gaudron and McHugh JJ observed:  “ ... [o]f all words, the word ‘business’ is notorious for taking its colour and its content from its surroundings ... ”  (Citation omitted.)  32 In the present case the most relevant aspect of the surroundings of the word “business” is the definition of “main business” contained in r 1.11 (at [5] above). To understand the nature of a business that can be a “main business” it is necessary to give consideration to the definitions contained in s 134(10) of the Act and r 1.03 respectively of “ownership interest” and “qualifying business” (at [6] and [7] above). Each of these expressions is used in r 1.11.  33 It is convenient to consider first the definition of “qualifying business”. This is because a “main business” in relation to an application for a visa must be a “qualifying business” (see r 1.11(1)(d)). It is significant, in my view, that a “qualifying business” is defined to mean an “enterprise” of a particular kind (at [7] above). Each of the Oxford English Dictionary and the Macquarie Dictionary confirms that “enterprise” is a word of general meaning which is broadly synonymous with “undertaking”. Had it been intended that an “enterprise” within the meaning of r 1.03 was to be limited to the commercial activities of a single legal entity, whether a natural person, a partnership or a company, one would have expected the regulation to say so.  34 The inference to be drawn from the use in the definition of “qualifying business” of the word “enterprise” is strengthened by the use in the s 134(10) definition of “ownership interest” of the indefinite article in respect of the words “company” and “partnership” (at [6] above). It seems plainly to be intended that an “ownership interest” in relation to a business can derive from, for example, a shareholding in a company that carries on the business together with another entity. Were it not so intended, para (a) of the s 134(10) definition would presumably read: “a shareholder in the company that carries on the business.”  35 I conclude that it is not a necessary characteristic of a “main business” for the purpose of the criterion specified by cl 845.215 that the business be carried on by a single entity. I do not understand the respondent to have contended that, as a matter off construction of cl 845.215, a “main business” may not extend beyond the commercial activity of a single entity. Rather, as I understood the case of the respondent, it was argued that, by completing form 1138 in the way in which he did (at [12] above), the applicant limited his claim to be entitled to the business visa to a claim based on his interest in Holdmark. To this extent the respondent supported the approach adopted by the Tribunal. In Liang v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 189;  (2009) 175 FCR 184 at  [193] the Court said:  29 The appellant also advanced the argument that the Tribunal\\'s conclusion that, at the time of the application, GNI operated, as nominated, two “main businesses”, was erroneous, because those businesses “are in fact the same business”.  30 There was no error in the way in which the learned federal magistrate approached the meaning of the word “business” and its reach. As did Branson J in Nassif  129 FCR at 454-455), I gain assistance as to the meaning the word from standard dictionaries. The word undoubtedly has chameleon like qualities, taking its meaning from the context in which it is used. In both the Oxford English Dictionary and the Macquarie Dictionary the meaning of the word “business”, when used in a commercial sense, is “enterprise”. That is the sense in which it is used in the terms “main business” and “qualifying business” in the Regulations. That this is so is reinforced by its being treated, in the definition of “qualifying business”, as a synonym for “enterprise”.  31 So construed, there is nothing about the meaning of the word “business” as used in the context of the Regulations which carries with it the necessary corollary that a legal entity can only ever, on its true meaning, have or conduct but one “business”. Such a construction of the word “business” accords with common experience. It is by no means unusual for a legal entity to cease one particular field of commercial endeavour by the disposal of what is aptly termed a “business” without ceasing altogether to trade.  32 Given this meaning of the word, whether or not GNI had one or two “main businesses” was nothing more than a question of fact and one for the Tribunal alone. The learned federal magistrate well appreciated this (reasons for judgment, [44]). It is certainly not one this Court on subsequent appeal. The delegate was prepared to treat the corporate entity as conducting a main business but found the evidence was insufficient to support the net value for the assets as required by the regulations.  The Tribunal said in para.7:  7. The issue in the present case is whether the applicants can rely on Cutman as one main business for the purpose of satisfying cl.892.212(c), which requires the net value of the assets of the first named applicant in his main business was at least $75,000 for the period of 12 months immediately prior to the date of the visa application. The language of ‘one main business’ appears to be that of the Tribunal and is a deflection on the correct criteria.  The Tribunal noted that the applicant must meet two of the three alternative requirements in cl.892.212.  In order to meet the requirements of cl.892.212 as a whole the Tribunal relevantly said:  9. It is not in question that the Queensland state government (as the appropriate regional authority) has not certified there are exceptional circumstances which would exempt the applicants from the need to satisfy cl.892.212. Therefore the first named applicant must satisfy two of the three alternate criteria in clause 892.212 in order to meet the requirements of cl.892.212 as a whole:  a. 892.212(a): It is not in question that the first named applicant has provided satisfactory evidence (pay records, identity documents) that he meets 892.212(a). Styleworx had the equivalent of more than one full-time Australian citizen or permanent resident employee for the relevant 12 month period. The Tribunal finds the first named applicant meets the requirements of cl.892.212(a).  b. 892.212(b): During the hearing, the first named applicant gave evidence that the net value of the personal and business assets of the first named applicant and the second named applicant in Australia during the relevant period did not amount to AUD$250,000. He explained the applicants had assets of that net value in Australia in December 2013, but not in December 2012. The Tribunal finds the first named applicant and/or the second named applicant did not have assets to the net value of AUD$250,000 in Australia for the relevant 12 month period. The Tribunal finds the first named applicant does not meet the requirements of cl.892.212(b).  c. 892.212(c): As noted above this is the key issue for the Tribunal to determine. Whether the net value of the assets of the first named applicant in his main business was at least $75,000 for the relevant period. It is not in question that the first named applicant is only able to demonstrate that net value of assets if he is permitted to rely on Cutman as one main business. The Tribunal considers this in more detail below. The Tribunal identified that the key issue to determine was cl.892.212(c) and again made reference to the deflecting concept of ‘one main business’.  The expression used in cl.892.212 refers to \"the main business or main businesses in Australia\".  The Tribunal posed for itself the question as a heading \"Does the First-named Applicant Have One Business or Four Businesses?\"  Under that heading the Tribunal then posited:  Whether the first named applicant has one business or four businesses is relevant to the definition of ‘main business’ and ‘qualifying business’. This introduction in para.10 by the Tribunal suggests that the Tribunal understood its task as to determine whether there was one business or whether there were four businesses for the purpose of applying the definition of \"main business\" and \"qualifying business\".  This focus by the Tribunal on the concept of one business or one main business was not correct.  After referring to the definition of \"main business\" in reg.1.11, the Tribunal summarised the requirements as follows:  10. ...Main business is defined in r.1.11, and the requirements include:  a. The first named applicant has an ‘ownership interest’ in the business;  b. The first named applicant has maintained a direct and continuous involvement in the management of the business from day to day and in making decisions affecting the overall direction and performance of the business;  c. The value of the ownership interest of the first named applicant and the second named applicant in the business was at least 10% of the total value of the business; and  d. The business is a ‘qualifying business’. That summary by the Tribunal is a departure from the language of the definition of \"main business\" in reg.1.11.  The definition in reg.1.11 materially refers to \"a business is a main business\".  The departure from the Regulations means that the Tribunal did not focus on the correct issue.  The Tribunal referred to the meaning of \"ownership interest\" and \"qualifying business\" and relevantly said:  14. The applicants contend they are entitled to consider all four businesses owned by Cutman as one main business. Before the delegate, they argued this is because the four businesses are operated under the same ABN, issued to Cutman. The Tribunal put to the applicants at the hearing it appeared to the Tribunal that they may only nominate two of their four businesses to be main businesses to satisfy the visa criteria. They may not rely on all four businesses. The first sentence of para.14 does not correctly identify the case propounded by the applicants which the delegate accepted, namely, that the four businesses owned by Cutman were a main business.  The Tribunal continued to focus on the concept of one main business rather than a main business.  The Tribunal in the paragraph above referred to the ABN issued to Cutman that was operating those four businesses.   The last sentence of para.14 identifies the Tribunal wrongly assuming that the applicants may only nominate two of their four businesses to be a main business.   That second last sentence of para.14 does not reflect a consideration of the correct issue of whether the four businesses operated by Cutman were a main business within the meaning of reg.1.11.  Rather, the reasoning reflects an assumption by the Tribunal that the four businesses are each main businesses and that there is no other main business.  That assumption deflects from the correct issue referred to above.  The Tribunal continued in that paragraph \"they may not rely on all four businesses\".  That was a reference to the assumption by the Tribunal that reg.1.11(2) had application in respect of the four business activities operated by Cutman.  That provision, reg.1.11(2), identifies that there may be an ownership interest in more than one qualifying business.  The importance of that provision however is that, in relation to that ownership interest, the applicant must not nominate more than two of those qualifying businesses as main businesses.   In the present case the applicant\\'s ownership interest was the shareholding in the corporate entity operating the four different business activities.  There was no separate ownership interest that the applicant had in relation to the four different business activities.  True it is that the reg.1.11 identifies a distinction between the entity that operates a business and the business itself. That distinction does not diminish the fact that reg.1.11(2) was expanding the category of ownership interests in a qualifying business for the purpose of meeting the criteria.  Regulation 1.11(2) does not in my opinion have application to the same ownership interest.  The notion that the first applicant must not nominate more than two of businesses as a main business where it is the same ownership interest wrongly assumes that there is not a main business in the present case.  The issue in the present case as to whether Cutman was operating a main business within the meaning of the regulations was not correctly identified or addressed in para.14 by the Tribunal. In para.16 the Tribunal repeated the acknowledgment that the delegate was willing to accept Cutman as one main business which again was not the correct issue and is a deflection from ‘a main business’ following which the Tribunal said:  16. ...The Tribunal noted that may be the case, but in its view, there was still an issue as to whether applicants had four main businesses, not one.  The reference to whether the applicant had four main businesses, not one, by the Tribunal again does not reflect a correct consideration of the question whether Cutman had a main business within the meaning of the regulation.  The Tribunal continued in para.16 as follows:   16. ... The Tribunal was mindful there were situations where perhaps it was arguable four separate businesses could be considered one main business. It gave the example of a company owning four hairdressers at four different locations, which all operated under the same name and business system. However, in the circumstances of the applicants, they had four very different, very individual businesses. The fact that there were very different individual businesses is not determinative of itself of the correct question in the application of the criteria under reg.1.11.  The Tribunal appears to have assumed that there must be a mutually exclusive application of the criteria by the regulation of either four separate businesses or one main business.  That is not the work done by the regulation. In para.17 the Tribunal said:  17. The Tribunal discussed with the applicants it had reviewed the frequently asked questions pages of the government webpages of ASIC and the Australian Business Register. Therein is readily available information it is permissible for a company to own more than one business and it is permissible for more than one business to operate under the same ABN. Having regard to that information, the Tribunal did not consider the argument regarding the ABN to be persuasive that Cutman was one main business. The fact that a corporate entity may own and operate more than one business under the same ABN is clearly a relevant factor in the present case.  The Tribunal\\'s observation that the use of the same ABN was not persuasive that Cutman \"was one main business\" repeats the erroneous concept of singularity and reflects an incorrect approach that a main business must be mutually exclusive of other business activities or enterprises. That mutually exclusive concept probably flows first from the Tribunal\\'s identification of the summarised requirements of reg.1.11 by erroneously focusing upon the applicant\\'s ownership in interest \"in the business\".  \"The business\" was not the language of the definition in the regulations.  Secondly, the error of mutually exclusive concepts of main business flows from the erroneous singularity concept and repeated preference to ‘one main business’.   In para.18 the Tribunal identified the discussion with the applicants in relation to the definitions and the case law meaning of \"business\".  In para.19 the Tribunal characterised the submission advanced for the applicant was that Cutman is \"one main business\".  The submissions that were set out at pp.498 to 501 do not, in fact, use the language of \"one main business\".   Whilst the Tribunal\\'s reasons must be read as a whole and without a keen eye to error, the reference to \"one main business\" is clearly a reference to the Tribunal\\'s own erroneous reasoning in its approach to the determination of the review.  The correct question was not whether there was one main business but rather whether Cutman was operating a main business within the meaning of the regulation and then whether the criteria under cl.892.212(c) were met.    The Tribunal in para.19 summarised the submissions and responded as follows:  19. In the post hearing submissions, the migration agent submitted it was not only the preferable position, but also the correct position under law that Cutman is one main business. He raised several reasons for that:  a. He referred again to the July 2014 request for information in which the delegate indicated a willingness to consider Cutman as one main business. He referred to case notes of the delegate regarding internal advice querying the meaning of the word ‘business’ and that a business is to be regarded as the entity or entities sharing the same ABN. As correctly submitted by the migration agent the Tribunal is conducting a hearing de novo. For the reasons set out in this decision, it does not agree the use of one ABN means that Cutman is one main business.  b. He referred to departmental policy regarding accepting interrelated companies (one asset holding the other operational) as being one main business. That policy is not relevant to the circumstances of the applicants. There is only one company, Cutman. Elsewhere in that policy, it refers to: “the ABN will identify the single business to be considered the qualifying business.” Again, the Tribunal does not agree that the use of one ABN means that Cutman is one main business.  c. He referred to the case of Nassif 2 in which the court noted the use of ‘a business’ not ‘the business’ in the definition of ownership interest in s.134(10). He submitted the reasoning of the court that the legislature did not intend to limit the definition to a single entity supported the view different ventures conducted under the same ABN could be used to satisfy 892.211. He further submitted the policy explicitly excludes passive investments (although he later refers to speculative investments) from consideration as main businesses. If multiple ventures were also intended to be excluded, similar policy could also have been created. The Tribunal does not consider the court’s reasoning in Nasif to be relevant to the issue before it. The Tribunal accepts the first named applicant has an ownership interest in each of businesses. The question before the Tribunal is how many of those businesses can the first named applicant rely on to satisfy 892.212(c). The Tribunal too is not persuaded by the lack of policy regarding multiple businesses. The migration agent has overlooked the prohibition on passive/speculative investments is actually within the definition of ‘qualifying business’ in r.1.03. It is not a creature born of policy alone. As to the legislature’s intention regarding the number of main businesses an applicant may rely on, well that too is clearly legislated for in the definition of main business in r.1.11, imposing a limit of not more than two.  d. He referred to policy advice on the calculation of owner’s equity on director loans and again submitted the absence of explicit policy on using multiple ventures under the same ABN meant it was intended to be permissible. The Tribunal is not persuaded by that submission. There is no requirement for the policy to have regard to every possible permutation of business structure which may appear before it. Again, as noted above, the determinative issue before the Tribunal is how many main businesses the first named applicant has. Once that issue is resolved, it is only then calculations of ownership interest or director loans becomes relevant. It is therefore not surprising that the policy is silent regarding the question of multiple businesses using the same ABN.  e. Mr Snyman Jr was granted a subclass 892 visa relying on Cutman as his main business. The visa grant letter date February 2014 was provided as was a submission letter to the department from the migration agent of Mr Snyman Jr dated August 2013 noting Cutman operated two businesses, La Rotunda Café and Styleworx. The Tribunal notes Cutman sold La Rotunda Café before 7 December 2012. That submission letter makes reference to the (at that time) recent acquisition by Cutman of Cutman Liquor (which would appear to be Vortik Fusion) and Fitzsimmons. These were relied on for time of decision criteria, not to meet the requirements of 892.213. Thus on the evidence before it, the grant of Mr Snyman Jr’s visa would appear to have been on the basis of Cutman having two main businesses for the purpose of 892.213, La Rotunda and Styleworx – which is within the limitation of r.1.11.  f. The applicants were nominated by the Queensland State Government on the basis of having four businesses. The applicants’ application for sponsorship was provided detailing the four businesses. The Tribunal notes that application includes a declaration by the first named applicant which acknowledges the final decision to grant or refuse a visa is one made by the department. The Tribunal does not consider it incumbent on the Queensland state government to assess whether the applicant has one or four main businesses in assessing whether or not to nominate the applicants for the visa.   g. The activities of Cutman are regular, ongoing and of benefit to Australia. That may be the case. That does not mean Cutman is one main business. The last paragraph, (g), again refers to the concept of \"one main business\" which for the reasons given is a deflection from the actual criteria that was required to be applied by the Tribunal under the regulations.  That same concept of one main business is also referred to in the last sentence of paragraph (a) quoted above.  Again, that is not the language of the regulation and is a deflection from the correct criteria. The use of the indefinite article was the subject of focus in the submissions advanced to the Tribunal by the applicants, namely:  The different ventures undertaken by a corporation with an Australian business number is, in fact, compliant for purposes of 892.211 and if the legislature or policymakers intended to exclude it one would have expected it to be explicitly excluded in the way specific instruments were. The force of the reasoning in Nassif v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCA 481;  (2003) 129 FCR 448 was the broader role given by use of the indefinite article rather than the definite article.  In this case, it was not the task under the regulations of the Tribunal to determine whether there was one main business, as might be consistent with the use of the definite article.   The reasoning to which the applicants referred in submission to the Tribunal quoted above made reference to Nassif at [33] as follows:  33. It is convenient to consider first the definition of “qualifying business”. This is because a “main business” in relation to an application for a visa must be a “qualifying business” (see r 1.11(1)(d)). It is significant, in my view, that a “qualifying business” is defined to mean an “enterprise” of a particular kind (at [7] above). Each of the Oxford English Dictionary and the Macquarie Dictionary confirms that “enterprise” is a word of general meaning which is broadly synonymous with “undertaking”. Had it been intended that an “enterprise” within the meaning of r 1.03 was to be limited to the commercial activities of a single legal entity, whether a natural person, a partnership or a company, one would have expected the regulation to say so. There is force in the applicant\\'s contention that the logic identified in Nassif had application in the present case insofar as if it was intended that a legal entity operating a number of commercial activities was to be excluded from being a main business the regulation could easily have said so.  The Tribunal\\'s observation that it did not consider the reasoning in Nassif to be relevant is consistent with the Tribunal not addressing the correct question in the present case. The Tribunal then continued its reasoning by reference to the ASIC and ATO documents and relevantly said:  20. From the ASIC and ATO documents on the departmental file, the Tribunal accepts all four businesses are owned by Cutman and operate using the same ABN. From the operational documents on the departmental file and the evidence of the first named applicant and Mr Snyman Jr at the hearing, as well as the documents provided after the hearing particularly regarding the operations of SEMS and Vortik Fusion, the Tribunal is satisfied each of the first named applicant’s four businesses are qualifying businesses. Each is profit driven. Each provides goods and or services. Each is neither a passive nor a speculative investment. The reference to all four businesses in the opening sentence reflects an assumption that there is no business being conducted by Cutman and does not reflect a correct assessment of the question required to be addressed as to whether Cutman was operating a main business within the meaning of the regulation.   The findings made by the Tribunal in the balance of para.20 are also not a correct application of the question that arises as identified.  The Tribunal continued referring to its finding made in para.20 and said:  21. In reaching its finding, the Tribunal is mindful of the four businesses operating under the same ABN, but on the basis of the information on the ASIC and ABR websites that a company may own more than one business and more than one business may operate under the same ABN, the Tribunal is not persuaded the use of one ABN makes Cutman a main business. That explanation of the Tribunal\\'s finding is consistent with the Tribunal incorrectly assuming that a main business being operated by Cutman is inconsistent with Cutman having four different business activities for the purpose of the regulations.  There is no such inconsistency in a correct application of the regulations.  The Tribunal continued in para.21:  21. ...For the same reasons, the Tribunal does not consider relevant any departmental policy which equates the identity of a main business to a single ABN. Whether or not a business is a main business or a qualifying business is a question answered by applying the circumstances of the Cutman to the definition of main business and qualifying business in the regulations. Whilst the above balance of para.21 does suggest the Tribunal was focusing upon whether Cutman operated a main business within the meaning of the criteria, the reasoning of the Tribunal to which I have referred above does not reflect an actual application of that question.  In my opinion the erroneous approach of the Tribunal is highlighted by the second sentence in para.22, which is as follows:  22. The Tribunal finds the financial statements of Cutman for the relevant period that the applicants provided to the delegate are in effect a consolidation of the activities of the four businesses. Cutman itself is not an enterprise that is operated for profit through providing goods or services. Cutman is the interposed legal entity which owns the four businesses. For that reason, Cutman is not a qualifying business and it follows therefore Cutman is not a main business. The first named applicant therefore cannot rely on the consolidated financial statements of Cutman to meet the requirements of cl.892.212(c). The consolidation of the four different business activities into one set of accounts recognised by the Tribunal in the first sentence was again not determinative of the application of the criteria under the regulation as to whether Cutman was operating a main business. The second sentence is entirely consistent with the erroneous mutually exclusive assumption by the Tribunal that Cutman cannot both itself operate a main business and have four main business activities that it is operating. Further it is clearly wrong to say that Cutman was not an entity that was carrying on an enterprise operated for profit through the provision of goods and services.  That second sentence in my opinion reinforces the same erroneous approach that was identified by para.14 in the reasoning of the Tribunal.  This erroneous approach is consistent with the Tribunal\\'s reasoning in the first sentence of para.23 which provides as follows:  23. It is open to the first named applicant to nominate up to two of his four businesses as his main businesses. From the evidence available to the Tribunal, Cutman did not own Fitzsimmons for the entire relevant 12 month period. It is unclear what the individual turnovers or the value of the first named applicant’s director loans in each of the four businesses was. It appears only Styleworx had sufficient employee numbers for the purpose of 892.212(a). At the hearing, the Tribunal indicated it had insufficient evidence before it to calculate whether one or more combinations of up to two of the four businesses could meet the visa criteria. The Tribunal invited the applicant to provide evidence after the hearing whether any combination of up to two of the four businesses is able to demonstrate he is able to meet the requirements of all of cl.892.212(a), 892.212(b) and 892.213 (regarding turnover). The post hearing submission is silent on that issue. The first sentence, again, is consistent with an erroneous focus upon the four business activities being mutually exclusive of a main business being conducted by Cutman.  I am satisfied that the Tribunal failed to apply the correct statutory test in relation to reg.1.11 in the context of the criteria under cl.892.212 by failing to determine whether Cutman operated a main business within the meaning of the regulation. In circumstances where the four enterprises were consolidated into one accounting entity for the purpose of both business operation under the ABN as well as for tax purposes, this is clearly a case where it was open to the Tribunal, correctly applying the criteria under cl.892.212 and reg.1.11, to find that Cutman was operating a main business.  Whether in respect of that position the criteria could be met was then a matter for the Tribunal to determine if it found that Cutman was operating a main business.   Counsel for the first respondent submitted that on a fair reading of the Tribunal\\'s decision as a whole the Tribunal had properly addressed the question of whether Cutman was operating a main business.  For the reasons I have given I do not accept that submission and in my opinion the Tribunal deflected itself from the application of the requirements of reg.1.11 by its focus on \"the business\" and the concept of \"one main business\" and the assumption that the four business activities must be mutually exclusive from a main business conducted by Cutman to fall within the regulations. I find that the Tribunal failed to correctly apply the statutory criteria in its review constituting a jurisdictional error. I certify that the preceding forty-eight (48) paragraphs are a true copy of the reasons for judgment of Judge StreetAssociate:  Date:  19 October 2015       ',\n",
       " 'Sun & Ors v Minister for Immigration & Anor [2015] FCCA 2479 (11 September 2015)': \"  By their further amended application filed on 6 March, 2014 the applicants seek judicial review of a decision of the second respondent made on 3 June, 2013 which affirmed a decision of a delegate of the first respondent to refuse the applicants Business Skills (Residence) (Class DF subclass 892 State/Territory Sponsored Business Owner) visas.  The applicants seek relief in the form of writs of certiorari and mandamus.  Generally speaking, the issue in this application is whether the second respondent was correct when it found that the applicants had given to the tribunal bogus documents within the meaning of that term as used in public interest criteria 4020 of schedule 4 to the Migration Regulations 1994. Background  On 5 January, 2010 the applicant, Jibo Sun, applied for a Business Skills (Residence) (Class DF subclass 892 State/Territory Sponsored Business Owner) visa.  The other applicants, Yuechang Tan and Junhao Sun are members of Mr Sun’s family unit and they sought visas as members of his family unit.  Their entitlement to visas is entirely dependent upon the success of Mr Sun’s application.  They advance no independent grounds for the grant of a visa. To be successful in his visa application, Mr Sun needed to satisfy the numerous criteria prescribed by the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) and the Migration Regulations 1994 that were applicable to the class of visa for which he had applied.  One criterion, set out in cl.892.221 of Schedule 2 to the Regulations, was a criterion to be satisfied at the time of the decision on his visa application.  It required Mr Sun to demonstrate that he continued to satisfy the criteria in cll.892.211 and 892.214 of schedule 2 to the Regulations. For present purposes, cl.892.211 is relevant.  It required that Mr Sun demonstrate that he continued to have, an ownership interest in 1 or more actively operating main businesses in Australia.  The proper interpretation of cl.892.211 is dependent upon the definitions of main business and ownership found in regs.1.11 and 1.11A of the Regulations. To demonstrate satisfaction of cl.892.211 at the time of the decision on his visa application (and thereby cl.892.221), Mr Sun claimed to have been involved in two Australian companies, Joyful View Garden Real Estate Development Resort Co Pty Ltd and Aquamarine International Tour & Assessment Co Pty Ltd which together traded as “Cherrabah Resort”.  He claimed that he had been a manager of the companies since September, 2004 and a director since August, 2009. There were two other directors, Mr Wenxing Ma and Mr Wenwei Ma, who had been directors since 2004.  He claimed that those matters demonstrated that he met the requirements of cll. 892.211 and 892.221 of schedule 2 of the Regulations. On 21 May, 2010 a delegate of the first respondent refused the visa application.  One of the grounds for the refusal was that the delegate was not satisfied that the first applicant had maintained direct and continuous involvement in Mr Sun’s nominated main business as required by the Regulations.  The respects in which the delegate thought that Mr Sun did not meet the criterion are not particularly important for the purposes of these reasons.  However, Mr Sun’s application failed at this hurdle before the first respondent’s delegate. Mr Sun sought a review of the delegate’s decision by a migration review tribunal.  Not surprisingly, the issue that concerned the first respondent’s delegate, also concerned the tribunal.  In response to correspondence from the tribunal, Mr Sun produced a significant number of documents related to the management of the nominated main business and his role in it.  Of those documents, 11 caught the attention of the tribunal.  The documents were the same as, or similar to, documents that had been submitted to the first respondent’s department in connection with visa applications made by Mr Sun’s co-directors Mr Wenxing Ma and Mr Wenwei Ma.  The tribunal’s concerns are set out in the following paragraph:  41. As the Tribunal also had access to the Class DF applications of Mr Wenxing Ma and Mr Wenwei Ma, it noted that some of the same documents had been submitted to the Department in relation to their respective visa applications.  In some of the documents, the signature of Mr Wenwei Ma was no longer present and the signature of Mr Sun appeared in their place.  In other documents, the version of the document given to the Department in 2009 did not include the signature of Mr Sun.  Some of the invoices were, according to the document date, signed by Mr Sun when he was not present in Australia. At a hearing that occurred on 28 November, 2012 the tribunal put to Mr Sun its concerns with respect to each of the eleven documents.  The tribunal clearly put him on notice that there had to be no evidence that Mr Sun had given the tribunal a bogus document or evidence that was false or misleading in a material particular relevant to the visa.  The tribunal pointed out that the information about the signatures may lead the tribunal to find that the relevant documents were bogus documents because they had been altered by a person who did not have authority to do so, or the documents were counterfeit as the signatures did not appear when the document was presented to the Department at an earlier time.  The tribunal raised a number of other concerns with Mr Sun and took evidence from a witness called by Mr Sun.  The tribunal heard submissions from his representative. By a letter dated 19 December, 2012 sent pursuant to s.359A of the Act the tribunal suggested that signatures or words that appeared in the relevant documents had been removed and that Mr Sun's signature appeared in their place.  The tribunal identified each of the documents in question.  In its reasons for decision, the tribunal summarises the letter:  88. The Tribunal stated this information is relevant to the review because it may lead the Tribunal to find that these documents have been altered by removing some of the signatures and replacing them with those of Mr Sun, or adding the signature of Mr Sun to the documents in order to enhance his application for the visa and was not a true representation of Mr Sun’s claimed role in the businesses.  The Tribunal stated this may lead it to find that he has given, or caused to be given a bogus document or information that is false or misleading in a material particular in relation to his application for the visa.  The Tribunal stated this may also lead the Tribunal to find that he could not meet an essential criteria for any other visa subclass in Class DF.    89. The Tribunal also invited the applicants to provide information in relation to the issue of the waiver of PIC 4020(1).  The applicants were provided until 16 January 2013 to provide comments or response.  The representative requested additional time to make submissions and this was granted until 15 February 2013. All of this was important because cl.892.223(a) of schedule 2 to the Regulations specified other criteria that Mr Sun needed to satisfy at the date of the decision on his visa application.  Those criteria were public interest criteria 4001, 4002, 4003, 4004, 4007, 4009, 4010, 4020 and 4021 set out in Part 1 of schedule 4 to the Regulations.  Of interest in this case is PIC 4020.  Relevantly, PIC 4020 required that:   (1)  There is no evidence before the Minister that the applicant has given, or caused to be given, to the Minister, an officer, the Migration Review Tribunal, a relevant assessing authority or a Medical Officer of the Commonwealth, a bogus document or information that is false or misleading in a material particular in relation to:  (a)  the application for the visa; or  (b)  a visa that the applicant held in the period of 12 months before the application was made.   (2)  The Minister is satisfied that during the period:           (a)  starting 3 years before the application was made; and  (b)  ending when the Minister makes a decision to grant or refuse to grant the visa;  the applicant and each member of the family unit of the applicant has not been refused a visa because of a failure to satisfy the criteria in subclause (1).   (3)  To avoid doubt, subclauses (1) and (2) apply whether or not the Minister became aware of the bogus document or information that is false or misleading in a material particular because of information given by the applicant.   (4)  The Minister may waive the requirements of any or all of paragraphs (1)(a) or (b) and subclause (2) if satisfied that:  (a)  compelling circumstances that affect the interests of Australia; or  (b)  compassionate or compelling circumstances that affect the interests of an Australian citizen, an Australian permanent resident or an eligible New Zealand citizen;  justify the granting of the visa.  (5)  In this clause:  information that is false or misleading in a material particular means information that is:  (a)  false or misleading at the time it is given; and  (b)  relevant to any of the criteria the Minister may consider when making a decision on an application, whether or not the decision is made because of that information. Regulation 1.03 provides that a bogus document has the same meaning as in s.97 of the Act, which at the relevant time stated:  97 Interpretation  Bogus document, in relation to a person, means a document that the Minister reasonably suspects is a document that:  (a) purports to have been, but was not, issued in respect of the person; or  (b) is counterfeit or has been altered by a person who does not have authority to do so; or  (c) was obtained because of a false or misleading statement, whether or not made knowingly. In reply to its s.359A letter of 19 December, 2012 the tribunal received a submission from Mr Sun’s representative by facsimile on 15 February, 2013.  On 3 June, 2013 the tribunal affirmed the delegate’s decision, concluding at [119] of its decision that:  119. The evidence leads the Tribunal to reasonably suspect that the 11 documents given by the applicants to the Tribunal have been altered by a person not authorised to do so because of the other versions of the same document provided to the Department in the visa applications of Mr Wenxing Ma or Wenwei Ma in which the signature of Mr Sun does not appear.  This leads the Tribunal to find that the applicants have given the Tribunal bogus documents in connection with the application.  The Tribunal notes that at the time these documents were signed and dated, Mr Sun had not been appointed as a Director of the company, held 10 percent of shares and claimed to be the Import and Receiving Manager and the Tribunal does not accept as plausible that he had any role in approving or indicating his approval for the expenditure of monies for contracts relating to building work, construction, plumbing, heating, signage or storage.    120. On the information before it, the Tribunal finds that the 11 documents submitted by the applicants to the Tribunal were bogus documents.  The Tribunal finds that there is evidence before it that the applicants have given, or caused to be given to the Tribunal in relation to the visa application a bogus document within the meaning of paragraph (b) of the ‘bogus document’ definition in s.97 of the Act.  Accordingly, the Tribunal finds that the applicants do not satisfy PIC 4020(1)(a).   The grounds of review  By their further amended application filed on 6 March, 2014 the grounds of review relied on by the applicants are:  1. The Tribunal, in making its decision on 3 June 2013, fell into jurisdictional error insofar as it made errors of law, which caused the Tribunal to reach the mistaken conclusion that there was evidence that the applicants had given “bogus documents” to the Tribunal within the meaning of that phrase in cl 4020(1) of Sch 4 of the Migration Regulations 1994 (Cth) (“the Regulations”), and such mistaken conclusion affected its exercise of its power under s 349 of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) (“the Act”) Particulars of errors of law  a)  The Tribunal misdirected itself in law as to which party carried the burden of proof, and the standard of proof to be met as to whether the documents in question were “bogus documents” within the meaning of that phrase in cl 4020(1) of Sch 4 of the Regulations.  b) The Tribunal misdirected itself in law as to the proper construction of the phrase “a document that ... has been altered by a person who does not have authority to do so” in section 97(b) of the Act.  c) The Tribunal misdirected itself in law as to the test of reasonable suspicion to be applied under section 97(b) of the Act.  2. The Tribunal’s decision was affected by jurisdictional error when it relied upon the eleven documents identified in paragraph [87] of the Tribunal’s reasons for decision when:  (a)  none of those documents were relevant to the issue before the Tribunal as to the applicant’s involvement in continuously managing the relevant business from day to day during the relevant period, that is from 6 January 2008 to 5 January 2010;and, or in the alternative,   (b)  none of those documents were given or caused to be given by the application to the Tribunal in relation to the applicant’s application for the visa within the meaning of PIC 4020. Consideration  There is no contention that for the purposes of the visa applications, Mr Sun gave, or caused to be given, to the tribunal the eleven documents in question.  Further, there is no contention that each of the relevant documents was not a document for the purposes of PIC 4020 and s.97 of the Act. The tribunal found that the documents had been altered for the purposes of s.97(b) of the Act and the definition of bogus document.  The applicants argue that in doing so, the tribunal misapplied the burden and standard of proof related to those findings.  They contend that the tribunal cast a burden on the applicants to satisfy the tribunal     that the documents had not been altered and therefore were not bogus documents.  Further, they argue that the tribunal did not appreciate that the evidence must establish the relevant facts leading to the finding that the documents were bogus to a high degree of satisfaction. Jasbeer Singh v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Unreported, Federal Court of Australia, 6 December 1994, NG319/1994) concerned s.20 of the Migration Act as it stood in 1994.  That section appears to be the forerunner of the present PIC 4020 and s.97 of the Migration Act.  Sackville J considered s.20 of the Act, as it existed at that time.  His Honour said, at page 8, that:  [n]ot only is the onus of establishing the facts on the Minister, but in applying that onus it is necessary to consider the serious consequences of falling within s.20(2).  As to the standard of proof, in Jasbeer Sackville J referred to the judgment of Wilcox J in Tarasovski v Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs [1993] FCA 515;  (1993) 45 FCR 570.  In Tarasovski, Wilcox J said at page 572 that a contravention of s.20 requires evidence to establish the contravention to “a high degree of satisfaction”.  Those statements of principle have been applied to the determination about whether a document is a bogus document for the purposes of s.97 of the Act: NBDY v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCAFC 145.  Of this case, the applicants submit that the Full Court of the Federal Court “has concluded that the burden and standard of proof as stated in [Jasbeer Singh and Tarasovski] are equally applicable to determining whether or not a document is a “bogus document” within the meaning of section 97 of the Act”. Indeed, in their joint-judgment at [31], Branson and Stone JJ held that:The [relevant tribunal] correctly directed itself as to the level of proof required in finding that the appellants had made false statements and the fact that the onus of discharging this burden lay on the Minister. In doing so it appropriately cited Jasbeer Singh v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs  [1994] FCA 1011 and Tarasovski v Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs [1993] FCA 515;  (1993) 45 FCR 570.  (my emphasis).  However, in my view reliance on NBDY and Jasbeer Singh is misplaced.  In each of those cases, the decisions under review by the Court concerned whether the applicants in those cases had produced a bogus document or made a statement that was false or misleading.  That is to say, in each of those cases, the decision maker was concerned with a positive finding that the applicant had produced a bogus document or made a statement that was false or misleading. PIC 4020 is different.  It requires that there be no evidence that the applicant has given, or caused to be given, to the Minister, an officer, the Migration Review Tribunal, a relevant assessing authority or a Medical Officer of the Commonwealth, a bogus document or information that is false or misleading in a material particular. Here the tribunal formed held concerns about the authenticity of eleven documents supplied by Mr Sun.  On their face, the concerns were appropriate.  The tribunal articulated the concerns in detail both during the tribunal’s hearings and afterwards in writing.  Mr Sun was invited to, and did, respond to the tribunal’s concerns.  The tribunal carefully analysed Mr Sun’s claims about the documents and explained why it did not find his accounts credible and why it concluded that the documents provided were bogus documents. I accept the first respondent’s submissions that NBDY was decided in a different legislative context.  In that case the legislative context in which it was decided was “where the Minister was statutorily empowered to cancel a person’s visa if satisfied that the person had provided bogus documents to the Minister”.  PIC 4020 is not to the same effect.  PIC 4020 applies to prospective visa applicants; it does not give the Minister a power to cancel visas that have already been granted.  The first respondent drew my attention to the judgement in Singh v Minister for Immigration & Anor [2013] FCCA 1435, where Judge Cameron stated at [25] that:For a document to be considered bogus, it is only necessary that the decision-maker “reasonably suspect” that it  (a) Purports to have been, but was not, issued in respect of the person; or (b) Is counterfeit or has been altered by a person who does not have authority to do so; or (c) Was obtained because of a false or misleading statement, whether or not made knowingly.A failure to meet the requirement of PIC 4020 will occur if there is evidence of a bogus document having been submitted. If a document which is found to be bogus under the relatively undemanding test in s.97 has been submitted in connection with a visa application, no more is needed to show that there is evidence of the sort referred to in PIC 4020. Consequently, although use of the word “evidence” in PIC 4020 may imply the need for probative evidence, as the criterion in this respect only requires evidence that a bogus document has been submitted, not that a document that has been submitted is bogus, in that respect it operates very differently from the criterion discussed in Talukder.  With respect, I agree with this interpretation of the requirements of PIC 4020.  In those circumstances, it is inappropriate to consider that there is an legal onus or burden of proof on either the Minister or a visa applicant arising from PIC 4020. In my view, the tribunal has not misdirected itself in law as to which party carried the burden of proof, and the standard of proof to be met as to whether the documents in question were “bogus documents”. The tribunal identified the correct approach at [108] of its reasons for decision where it said:The Tribunal will now consider whether there is no evidence before it that the applicants have given, or caused to be given to the Tribunal in relation to the visa application, a bogus document.   And the tribunal did so.  It found that there was such evidence.  No basis exists for disturbing that finding of fact.  It was, in any event, clearly correct.   This ground relied upon by the applicants fails to establish a jurisdictional error. Reasonable suspicion   The applicant contends that the tribunal “misdirected itself in law as to the test of reasonable suspicion to be applied under s.97(b) of the Act.”  The applicants’ argument can be summarised as follows. First, the applicant refers to the proposition that “[t]he facts which can reasonably ground a suspicion may be quite insufficient reasonably to ground a belief, yet some factual basis for the suspicion must be shown”: Hussien v Chong Fook Kam [1969] UKPC 26;  [1970] AC 942 and endorsed by in George v Rockett [1990] HCA 26;  (1990) 170 CLR 104. Second, Mr Sun contends that the tribunal, in its conclusions, made “findings of suspicion” as opposed to findings of fact.  Therefore, the applicants submit that it is not clear whether the requisite factual basis for suspicion existed.  The applicant also argues that the tribunal misdirected itself in this way partly due to the first respondent failing to carry the burden of proof. The applicants’ reference to a “finding” of suspicion is confusing.  The submissions do not explain what is meant by this notion.  What is a “finding” of suspicion?  In the context of s.97, it seems to me, a tribunal’s reasonable suspicion is a conclusion reached on the basis of material before the tribunal, not a “finding”.  In any event, the tribunal did identify the material upon which it formed its suspicion.  The tribunal set out, at length, the matters that concerned it about the eleven documents in question.  It set out its findings about Mr Sun’s explanations about the issues that concerned the tribunal at paragraphs [110] – [118] of its reasons for decision. Those findings and the evidence referred to extensively by the tribunal in its reasons for decision led the tribunal to the conclusions recorded at paragraph [14] above.  Those findings and conclusions were plainly open to the tribunal on the material before it. This ground fails to establish jurisdictional error. Relevance  On 10 December, 2013 the applicants were given leave to amend their application to include an additional ground of review.  The applicant’s took that opportunity.  The additional ground has two limbs. First, it is said that the eleven documents were not relevant to the issue that was taxing the tribunal, namely the level of involvement that the first applicant had in managing the relevant companies and business.  Second, the applicant argues that the eleven documents were not given “in relation to” the visa application within the meaning of PIC 4020.  The applicants submit that “the Tribunal failed to ask itself the critical question, i.e. whether the 11 documents were bogus documents supplied to it in relation to the 5 January 2010 application for a sub class 892 visa.” The tribunal proceeded on the footing that a “bogus document” does not have to be relevant to a visa criterion in order for PIC 4020 to be engaged: Batra v MIAC [2013] FCA 274;  (2013) 212 FCR 84.  PIC 4020 merely requires that there must be no evidence that the applicant has given or caused to be given a bogus document to the decision maker: Mudiyanselage v MIAC [2013] FCA 266;  (2013) 211 FCR 27.  However, the applicants contend these cases “are not authority for such a wide construction”. The applicants’ argument is that there must be a “nexus” between a bogus document and the grant of the visa.  A nexus is required because the words “in relation to” in PIC 4020(1) suggest such a nexus. Moreover, PIC 4020(2) prohibits further subsequent applications if an applicant (or a family member) fails to satisfy PIC 4020(2). The purpose of the legislative context surrounding the definition of “bogus document”, which according to Murphy J in Batra (at [57]) is “the maintenance of an effective migration system...”.  The applicants also submit that the necessity for a nexus was evident in Mudiyanselage.  They contend that in that case, even though the allegedly bogus document was withdrawn at the time of the tribunal hearing, because the document was a skills assessment—and the visa applied for was a skilled 885 visa—there was a sufficient nexus relied on by the Court to nevertheless find that a bogus document had been submitted in relation to the application.  However, the Court in that case clearly decided that the mere submission of a bogus document is sufficient to attract the operation of PIC 4020 regardless of the contents of the document. At [35], Tracey J indicated that the definition of bogus document does not have a materiality requirement and if it did, that would undermine the effectiveness of the migration system, by giving applicants an impunity to submit bogus documents in attempt bolster their success while having the option of withdrawing their reliance on them should they be discovered as bogus.  Neither limb of this ground of review has any merit.  This additional ground fails to establish jurisdictional error. Authority to alter  The applicant argues that the tribunal erred in its findings regarding the applicant’s lack of authority to alter the eleven subject documents.   This argument has two aspects. First, the applicant posits that since the Cherrabah Resort companies presumably had ownership rights over the relevant documents, it follows that they had the right “to authorise others to also alter each of those documents”. Hence, the applicant argues that the question the tribunal should have asked was whether the applicant had in fact been authorised by the companies to alter the eleven documents, whereas the question the tribunal in fact asked, the applicant suggests, was whether it was within the ordinary course of the applicant’s role to mark the documents in the manner they were altered.  Second, assuming the tribunal had asked the former question, the question became one of fact to be determined by the law of agency. Accordingly, the issue was whether the applicant held either express or implied actual authority to alter the documents.  Proceeding from the assumption that the Minister held the burden of proof regarding s.97 of the Act, the applicant concludes that the Minister had the burden of proving a negative proposition: that the applicant lacked express or implied authority to alter the eleven documents. However, in my opinion this issue is a red herring.  The primary issue for s.97 in terms of authority is whether the decision maker reasonably suspects there was a lack of authority — not whether authority was lacking as a matter of fact. They are different questions. I have already dealt with the question of reasonable suspicion. Moreover, the applicant’s suggestion that the Minister had the burden of proving the negative suggestion should be rejected for the reasons set out above concern the burden of proof.

       " 'Suri v Minister for Immigration & Anor [2015] FCCA 1570 (5 June 2015)': \"  This is an application within the Court’s jurisdiction under s.476 of the Migration Act 1958 for a Constitutional writ in respect of a decision of the delegate made on 18 March 2015, affirming a decision of the delegate not to grant the applicant a Skilled (Residence) (Class VB) visa.  The applicant applied for the visa on 7 February 2008 and it was refused by the delegate on 18 October 2012.  Relevantly, the Tribunal records that the delegate found that the TRA skills assessment was a bogus document.  Thus the applicant did not satisfy the Public Interest Criteria 4020(1) that clearly application as a matter of law at the time of the determination by the delegate. The grounds in the application are as follows:  1. The Tribunal fell into jurisdictional e1TOr in finding that the applicant failed to meet PIC 4020 as required by clause 885 .224 of the Migration Regulations.  Particulars  (a) PIC 4020 did not apply in the current case because the alleged bogus document said to have emanated from TRA was a legal nullity by reason of the failure to validly appoint TRA as the relevant assessing authority; and,  (b) By reason of the failure to appoint TRA as the relevant assessing authority the requirement to undertake a skills assessment in satisfaction of the statutory scheme was not a requirement and thus any document produced in purported satisfaction of that requirement was not information that was false or misleading in a material particular.  (c) At all relevant times the TRA skills assessment was not 'given' to the second respondent's servants or the first respondent (see paragraph 52 of decision record). There was no substance in relation to any of the grounds.  They failed to identify any jurisdictional error.  It is clearly the position that a bogus document was provided to the delegate.   The delegate was a relevant body in respect of PIC4020.  There is no substance in the proposition that any of the regulations were invalid.  To the extent that cl.885.222(1) provided the skills of the applicant has been assessed by the relevant assessing authority as suitable for the applicant's nominated skills occupation, there is no substance in the suggestion that that regulation was invalid.  The provision is clearly within the scope of the regulation-making power.  Moreover, it is clear that PIC4020 had pursuant to the Migration Amendment Regulation 2011 (No.1) pursuant to cl.5, application in the present case by reason of the application being one in respect of the amendments made to schedule 3 in relation to a visa application that was made but not finally determined before 2 April 2011.  There was no scope for the contention that PIC4020 had no application in the present case.   An argument was advanced by Mr Ford, the solicitor for the applicant, to the effect that because the entity in respect of which provided to the delegate a bogus document was an entity that had not been authorised under the relevant regulation, being cl.885.222(1), therefore somehow the provision of the bogus document to the delegate could not give rise to the application of PIC8020.  The substance of that argument was rejected by the Tribunal.  It was correct to do so.  It was open to the Tribunal to come to the adverse findings made in respect of the provision of the bogus document.  Relevantly the Tribunal found:  45. Based on the evidence before it, the Tribunal finds that the review applicant submitted with his application for the skills assessment to TRA a work reference letter from Bakers Hut dated 25 July 2007 as evidence that he worked as a volunteer pastry cook at Bakers Hut from 13 August 2006 to 21 July 2007. A copy of this letter was provided to the Tribunal on 26 November 2014 by TRA. The Tribunal noted that a copy of the letter was provided to the Tribunal.  The Tribunal then said:   46. Based on the evidence before it, which the Tribunal considers of sufficiently probative value, the Tribunal finds that the work reference letter given to TRA contained a false statement that the review applicant completed more than 900 hours’ work experience as a pastry cook at Bakers Hut. The Tribunal finds that the statement in the work reference letter regarding the applicant’s 900 hours’ work experience at Bakers Hut was purposefully false or misleading. The Tribunal then made a finding:  47.  Accordingly, the Tribunal finds that the skills assessment of 20 September 2007 (reference/receipt number TRA07/077197319) from TRA was obtained because of a false or misleading statement and that the skills assessment is a bogus document, being a document which the Tribunal reasonably suspects was obtained because of a false or misleading statement, whether or not made knowingly (s.97(c) of the Act). The Tribunal identified that it was required to make a factual finding, whether the applicant submitted the TRA reference assessment letter to the Department.  Relevantly the Tribunal concluded:  55. Based on the evidence before it, the Tribunal is satisfied that the applicant submitted the TRA skills assessment dated 20 September 2007 to the Department with his application for a subclass 885 visa as evidence of successful skills assessment in his nominated occupation of a pastry cook.  56. Accordingly, the Tribunal is not satisfied that there is no evidence that the the review applicant has given, or caused to be given, to the Minister, or an officer of the Department, the Tribunal or a relevant assessing authority a bogus document or information that is false or misleading in a material particular in relation to his application for a subclass 885 visa. Accordingly, the Tribunal finds that the review applicant does not meet the requirements of paragraph 4020(1)(a). It was in those circumstances that the Tribunal considered whether there were circumstances to waive the requirements of PIC4020 and relevantly found:  62. In considering whether to waive the requirements of subclause 4020(1), the Tribunal has considered whether there are compelling circumstances that affect the interests of Australia or compassionate or compelling circumstances that affect the interests of an Australian citizen, an Australian permanent resident or an eligible New Zealand citizen. The applicant did not claim the existence of any circumstances relevant to waiver provisions.  63. Accordingly, the Tribunal is not satisfied that there are compelling circumstances affecting the interests of Australia, or compassionate or compelling circumstances affecting the interests of Australian citizens, Australian permanent residents or eligible New Zealand citizens that justify the granting of the visa. Accordingly, the Tribunal has determined not to waive the requirements in subclause PIC 4020(1).   64. It follows that the review applicant does not satisfy the requirements of PIC 4020 for the purposes of cl.885.224 (a).  65. The Tribunal finds that the applicant does not meet the requirements for a Subclass 886 visa, as the Tribunal finds that the PIC 4020 in cl 886.225 (which parallels the requirement in 885.224) is not met, for the same reasons specified above in relation to the Subclass 885 visa.   66. The Tribunal finds that the applicant does not meet the requirements for a Subclass 887 visa, as nothing in the evidence before the Tribunal suggests that the applicant has held a visa of a type specified in cl. 887.212 – a mandatory requirement for that visa subclass. There was no error of the kind identified in ground 1.  It is clear that PIC4020 was both relevant and had application, and the Tribunal was correct to apply it.  There is no substance in the proposition that the document was not a bogus document in relation to ground 2.  It was a finding of fact of the Tribunal, and that finding was open on the material before the Tribunal.   Ground 3 is in substance equally misconceived, and it was open to the Tribunal to make the finding it did in respect of the Department being provided with the bogus document, which gave arise to the application of PIC4020.  The application is dismissed.I certify that the preceding twelve (12) paragraphs are a true copy of the reasons for judgment of Judge StreetAssociate:  Date:  9 June 2015       \",\n",
       " 'Tran v Minister for Immigration & Anor [2015] FCCA 3395 (18 December 2015)': ' Introduction  By this application for judicial review, the applicant claims the second respondent (Tribunal), contrary to s.360(1) of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) (Act), failed to give to the review applicant notice of two matters on which the Tribunal relied for affirming the decision of a delegate of the first respondent (Minister) not to grant the visa applicant and her family an Other Family (Migrant)(Class BO)(subclass 116) visa (Carer Visa).  Background The applicant (review applicant) is an Australian citizen of Vietnamese origin. She is a widow, and suffers from severe dementia, osteoporosis, and other conditions. Because of her medical condition, the review applicant requires 24 hour high-level care and assistance in her daily living.[1] The review applicant’s daughter (visa applicant), who also is a Vietnamese citizen, but, unlike the review applicant, resides in Vietnam, applied for a Carer Visa. She applied on 21 September 2012.[2] To have been entitled to a Carer Visa, the visa applicant had to satisfy the Minister she was a “carer” of the review applicant within the meaning of reg.1.15AA(1) of the Migration Regulations 1994 (Cth) (Regulations).  A person is a “carer” of another person within the meaning of reg.1.15AA(1) of the Regulations if, among other things: according to a certificate that complies with reg.1.15AA(2), the other person has a medical condition that is causing physical, intellectual or sensory impairment of the ability of that person to attend to the practical aspects of daily life; and because of the medical condition, the other person has, and will continue for at least two years to have, a need for direct assistance in attending to the practical aspects of daily life; and the “assistance cannot reasonably be: provided by any other relative of the resident, being a relative who is an Australian citizen, an Australian permanent resident or an eligible New Zealand citizen; or obtained from welfare, hospital, nursing or community services in Australia . . .” The delegate refused to grant a Carer Visa to the visa applicant because the review applicant’s “large family already in Australia can continue to provide the required care for the” review applicant, and because the delegate did not find any compelling reason for the visa applicant to travel to Australia to care for the review applicant.[3] The review applicant’s large family in Australia to which the delegate referred is the review applicant’s six children.   Review applicant’s case before the Tribunal Before the Tribunal, it was submitted on behalf of the review applicant that assistance in attending to the practical aspects of the review applicant’s daily life cannot reasonably be provided by any of her six children living in Australia. In support of that case, the following matters were submitted to the Tribunal: One of the review applicant’s daughters lives in Canberra, has work and young children there, and cannot relocate to Sydney.[4] Another daughter has full time work, and cares for her child who suffers from developmental delay and who, therefore, requires assistance.[5] One of the review applicant’s sons (Son B) suffers from multiple medical and mental conditions, including psychosis.[6] He lives in the house[7] in which the review applicant lived (Home) until the day she moved to a friend’s home one or two weeks before the visa applicant applied for the Carer Visa. The third daughter of the review applicant (Daughter A) lives in the Home.[8] She is married and has full time employment. She has to take care of Son B who suffers from anxiety, depression, and psychosis, and who often has violent outbursts, which requires control and supervision.[9] Another of the review applicant’s sons (Son A) also lives in the Home,[10] and has full time employment and cares for Son B.[11] The third of the review applicant’s sons has full time employment, is married, but does not get along with his mother.[12] Approximately one week before 14 September 2013, the review applicant moved out of the Home because she was worried about her safety because Son B “suffers from mental conditions [and] has become violent” and she is concerned for her well-being.[13] Proceedings before the Tribunal Son A gave evidence to the Tribunal that included the following: he lived in the Home; the Home was the family home; the Home has four bedrooms; until the review applicant moved out of the Home, Son A and Daughter A cared for the applicant; Son B is not very well; Son B became sick in 2007 with anxiety; he has never been in hospital, but he receives a disability pension; Son B began to have violent episodes in 2007 and 2008; those episodes consisted in Son B getting angry, hitting his head against the wall, and punching the door; Son B has not assaulted anyone; and Son A has never called the police because the matter is dealt with within the family. In response to the Tribunal saying “[t]ell me why your mother moved”, Son A said that since early September 2012 Son B “get so violent on that day, so my mother very scared” and she “want to move out to the present house”.[14] The house into which the review applicant moved (Present House) is about ten minutes drive from the Home, and is owned by a friend of Son A’s father. The review applicant has her own room in the Present House, and the owners prepare food for her. In the course of her questioning Son A, the Tribunal member said to Son A she had to consider whether “the care can reasonably be provided by your family members in Australia”, and that the main issue “is whether the relatives in Australia can reasonably provide the care”.[15] The following exchange then took place:[16] Son A: I think we have to work full-time and in our family there is a sick – a very sick person, and we cannot provide them a good care in a good way, for both of them. Member: But why did that suddenly change in 2012? Son A: Yes. Member: It seems odd that the situation changes just a week or two before you lodge this application, when you have been managing to cope with it for years. Son A: We cope with it for two year. Is very tiring for us. Before that, we wish to sponsor our sister, but the case that my mother move out is not the thing we expect, because it is – it suddenly happened. So we had to – and she doesn’t want to stay in our house with my sick brother any more. A little later the Tribunal member stated that the only medical report that relates to Son B was not “a very detailed medical report” and there was no evidence, apart from what Son A said, about Son B’s violent outbursts. [17] The Tribunal member allowed the review applicant to provide further medical evidence about Son B. The Tribunal member said:[18] It’s just too scant. This little bit of information is no good to me. I need details, lots of details, to be satisfied that you need to be caring for him, and that’s why you can’t care for your mother. The information the Tribunal required is evidenced in the following exchange:[19] Son A: You mean my brother’s full history? Member: Yes, yes. Detailed medical evidence about your brother’s mental illness and details of incidents which occurred. Son A: Incidents. What does that mean? Member: Incidents reported to the doctor. So if this is an ongoing issue, I would expect there will be a lot of medical evidence about him, especially if he is causing distress and people are fearful of him. I need to be satisfied about that. . . . Son A: Yes, but you can see it from me. Member: Because I haven’t spoken to your mother, so I can’t get the evidence from her, because I think she has difficulty communicating properly now; is that correct? Son A: No, she is illiterate. Member: So I am relying on your evidence, but you have a vested interest in this matter because you want to get your sister out here, so I need independent evidence. After the hearing, the Tribunal received a report from a consultant psychiatrist.[20] The report noted the psychiatrist first saw Son B in June 2012. By that time, Son B had been diagnosed with anxiety, osteoarthritis/chronic back pain, depression, rhinitis allergic, and psychosis with frequent episodes of violent behaviour and occasional thoughts of self-harm. The report stated the psychiatrist had seen Son B on four other occasions. On each occasion Son B told the psychiatrist that he hears various voices talking to him in Vietnamese to hurt himself, and he feels he is being followed and spied on. The report concluded that Son B suffers from “psychotic illness, namely schizophrenia”, and that he “continues to require full time care and supervision”. Tribunal’s decision The Tribunal was not satisfied that the review applicant’s children in Australia cannot provide the review applicant with the required care. Its reasoning is contained in the following passage from its reasons for decision:[21] The issue in the present case is whether the care cannot reasonably be provided by any other relative of the review applicant in Australia. The Tribunal notes that shortly before the time of application the review applicant was being cared for by her son, [Son A] and her daughter, [Daughter A] in the family home. It is claimed that the sponsor moved to a friend’s place because she was fearful of her son, [Son B]. The Tribunal accepts that [Son B] suffers from a psychotic illness and that he is under the care of a psychiatrist and taking medication. The Tribunal notes that the medical report from his psychiatrist mentions ‘violent outbursts resulting in self harm’ and his family reports that since December 2013, his violent outbursts are more regular and on each occasion the family members had to ‘refrain (sic) him from injuring himself’. The medical reports do not suggest that [Son B] is a danger to others. The Tribunal is not satisfied that the review applicant moved from her home because she feared her son, [Son B]. It is the Tribunal’s view that the move was arranged to strengthen the case for the visa applicant. The Tribunal accepts that it is challenging for [Son A and Daughter A] to provide the care for their mother and their brother. However, this is not sufficient for the Tribunal to be satisfied that they cannot reasonably provide the assistance required for the review applicant. The parties’ submissions The review applicant’s submissions are as follows:[22] s.360 of the Act requires the Tribunal to let the review applicant know, either expressly or by necessary implication, what are the issues, unless they arise from the delegate’s decision; the general issue of satisfaction of reg.1.15AA(1)(e) of the Regulations was raised in the delegate’s decision; however, the Tribunal dealt with that issue in a markedly different manner; in particular, the Tribunal reasoned that there was no evidence Son B was a danger to others, and the review applicant moved out of the Home, not because she was scared of Son B, but because those sponsoring the visa applicant’s application wanted to strengthen the visa applicant’s case; and the Tribunal came under an obligation to disclose the following two issues (Claimed Issues): whether Son B is violent towards others, including the review applicant; and whether the review applicant moved out of the Home to strengthen the visa-applicant’s case for a visa. The Minister, on the other hand, submits the Tribunal sufficiently raised both issues because both issues were subsets of other issues, the primary issue being whether the review applicant’s relatives in Australia could reasonably provide the care required by the review applicant. The elements of that submission are:[23] one of the issues before the Tribunal was whether the review applicant’s relatives could not reasonably provide the care required by the applicant; an underlying issue was whether the relatives could not reasonably provide the care required by the review applicant because she no longer lived in the same house as Son A and Daughter A; relevant to the issue in (b) were the reasons the review applicant left the Home at the time she did; the issue in (c) was before the Tribunal because the review applicant herself raised it in a statutory declaration she made in which the review applicant said she moved out of the Home because she was worried about her safety due to Son B’s mental condition; and the Tribunal itself raised it at the hearing; and the Tribunal also raised doubts about whether Son B’s condition was in fact the reason for the review applicant leaving the Home. Principles in SZBEL The outcome of the applicant’s challenge turns, in the first instance, on the correct application of the principles identified by the High Court in SZBEL v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (SZBEL principles).[24] Those principles may be summarised as follows:[25] At common law, a duty to accord procedural fairness consists in providing to the person likely to be affected by the decision with an opportunity to put information and submissions to the decision-maker in support of the outcome the persons seeks.[26] The duty extends to requiring the decision-maker to identify to the person likely to be affected “any issue critical to the decision which is not apparent from its nature or the terms of the statute under which it is made”, and to inform the person to be affected “of any adverse conclusion which has been arrived at which would not obviously be open on the known material”.[27] Section 360 of the Act defines the nature of the opportunity to be heard that is to be given to an applicant for review by the Tribunal.[28] It requires the Tribunal to invite the applicant to “give evidence and present arguments relating to the issues arising in relation to the decision under review”. Those issues will not be sufficiently identified in every case by describing them simply as whether the applicant is entitled to the visa in question.[29] The issues that arise in relation to the decision are to be identified by the Tribunal. If “the Tribunal takes no step to identify some issue other than those that the delegate considered dispositive, and does not tell the applicant what that other issue is, the applicant is entitled to assume that the issues the delegate considered dispositive are “the issues arising in relation to the decision under review”.”[30] There may be cases where the Tribunal’s statements or questions during a hearing sufficiently indicate to an applicant that everything he or she says in support of the application is in issue.That indication may be given in many ways. It is not necessary (and often would be inappropriate) for the Tribunal to put to an applicant, in so many words, that he or she is lying, that he or she may not be accepted as a witness of truth, or that he or she may be thought to be embellishing the account that is given of certain events. . . . But where . . . there are specific aspects of an applicant’s account, that the Tribunal considers may be important to the decision and may be open to doubt, the Tribunal must at least ask the applicant to expand upon those aspects of the account and ask the applicant to explain why the account should be accepted.[31]  Under the SZBEL principles, the Tribunal’s obligation to give notice arises only in relation to “issues”. At the very least, the issues in any application for review before the Tribunal would include asserted facts which, under the relevant criteria, the Tribunal must be satisfied exist before it can be satisfied the relevant criteria for the granting of the visa in question are met (principal facts). In most cases, however, the issues would extend beyond the principal facts; in all but the simplest of cases, the issues would also include asserted facts, the existence or non-existence of which are relevant to the existence or non-existence of the principal facts. There is every reason, at least in most cases, to regard asserted facts that are relevant to the existence or non-existence of the principal facts, to be “issues” for the purposes of the SZBEL principles. That is so because a finding on a fact relevant to the principal facts will or may bear on whether the Tribunal is satisfied that one or more of the principal facts exists or does not exist. In some cases, the issues may include matters that are relevant only to the credibility of the applicant. A corollary of these observations is that not every matter an applicant raises in a case, or which the Tribunal decides or considers, becomes an “issue” for the purposes of the SZBEL principles, only because the matter has been raised, or considered, or decided. A Tribunal’s considering and determining a matter that cannot reasonably be regarded as relevant to whether an applicant satisfies the criteria that apply to the granting of a visa cannot, therefore, be an “issue” that attracts the SZBEL principles. Relevant questions Having set out the relevant principles that are to guide me in determining the applicant’s case, it should be apparent there are three questions I must consider: were the Claimed Issues “issues” for the purposes of the SZBEL principles? If so, was the Tribunal required to give the review applicant notice of those issues? If so, did the Tribunal give the review applicant the requisite notice? Were the Claimed Issues “issues”? First claimed issue The review applicant relied on the medical condition of Son B as a reason for Son A’s and Daughter A’s not being in a position to look after the applicant. The reasons Son A gave for not being able to care for his mother are that he works full time and that he, together with Daughter A, jointly care for Son B;[32] and the reasons Daughter A gave are that she and Son A have to care for Son B who suffers from anxiety, depression, and psychosis, and that Son B has violent outbursts which require control and supervision which cannot be provided by one person alone.[33]  From this material, an issue arose about whether Son B was violent; and it was an issue the review applicant herself raised. Whether Son B was violent was relevant to the claims that Son A and Daughter A could not reasonably take care of the review applicant. Son B’s violent outbursts was something which required constant control and supervision; and because it was Son A and Daughter A who controlled and supervised Son B, it was not reasonable to expect that they also provide the review applicant with the required care.  Second claimed issue The review applicant, in her statutory declaration, stated she left the Home because she was worried about her safety due to Son B’s mental conditions and violence. It is unclear, however, what the intended relevance of that evidence was.  It was not suggested on behalf of the review applicant that her moving out of the Home and living in the Present House per se rendered it more unreasonable for her Australian relatives and, in particular, for Son A and Daughter A, to provide care to the review applicant. That is not surprising; if anything, the review applicant’s moving to the Present House, which was only a ten minute drive from the Home, could only have eased the burden on Son A and Daughter A because the review applicant received at least some support from the persons who live in the Present Home. Nor did Son A or Daughter A say they instigated the review applicant’s move out of the Home because, for example, they were unable to care for both Son B and the review applicant, or because they considered it unsafe for the review applicant to remain in the Home. Son A told the Tribunal that the applicant’s moving out was “not the thing we expect, . . . it suddenly happened”.[34] The reasons for which the review applicant moved out of the Home, therefore, formed no part of the review applicant’s case that the review applicant’s relatives cannot reasonably provide the care the review applicant requires. The Tribunal, however, did make a finding about the reasons for which the review applicant moved out of the Home, namely, to enhance the review applicant’s case that the review applicants’ children could not reasonably provide the care the review applicant required. Did that make the reasons why the review applicant moved out of the Home an issue before the Tribunal?  In my opinion, it did not. That can be seen by asking whether the Tribunal’s not deciding the review applicant moved out of the Home to enhance the claim for the grant of a Carer Visa could conceivably have made any difference to the decision the Tribunal made. It would have made no difference because the review applicant did not rely on her moving out of the Home as a reason for the review applicant’s relatives not reasonably being able to provide the review applicant the care she requires.  If, as I have found, there was no issue before the Tribunal about why the review applicant left the Home, it must follow there was no issue for the purposes of the SZBEL principles as to whether the applicant left the Home to strengthen her claim for the Carer visa.  Was the Tribunal required to give the applicant notice? The Tribunal was not required to give the review applicant notice that it regarded as an issue whether Son B is violent towards others, including the review applicant. That is so because it was the review applicant who claimed the review applicant experienced violent incidents because of Son B’s mental condition. The Tribunal’s finding the “medical reports do not suggest that [Son B] is a danger to others” was well within the scope of the issue the review applicant herself raised. As to the second claimed issue, given that I have found it was not an issue, the Tribunal was not required to give notice to the review applicant. If, contrary to my finding, the reason the review applicant left the Home was to strengthen the visa applicant’s case for a Carer visa was an issue, the Tribunal would have been required to give the review applicant notice of that issue. Did the Tribunal give the review applicant notice? Even though I have found the Tribunal was not required to give the review applicant notice that it regarded as an issue whether Son B is violent towards others, including the review applicant, the Tribunal nevertheless gave the review applicant notice of that issue. By describing in detail the type of information the Tribunal suggested the applicant should provide about Son B’s medical condition and, in particular, evidence of incidents, it would have been, or, at least, ought reasonably to have been, clear to those representing the review applicant that the Tribunal considered that, whether the medical condition of Son B and, in particular, whether he was prone to episodes of violence, including violence towards the review applicant, was an issue. If, contrary to my conclusion, whether or not the review applicant left the Home to enhance the visa-applicant’s case for the grant of a Carer Visa was an issue, the Tribunal did not give the review applicant notice of that issue. The Tribunal informed Son A it found it odd that “the situation changes just a week or two before you lodge this application, when you have been managing to cope with it for years”;[35] and before the Tribunal made that statement, it asked Son A why things suddenly change in 2012. That was obviously a reference to the review applicant’s having left the Home. From these two statements, it ought reasonably to have been apparent to those representing the review applicant that the Tribunal considered that the reason the review applicant left the Home was relevant. The statements, however, could not reasonably have alerted those who represented the review applicant that one reason the Tribunal might find the review applicant left the Home at the time she did was because those representing the review applicant desired to enhance the visa-applicant’s prospects of being granted a Carer Visa. Conclusions and disposition My conclusions are as follows: whether or not son B is violent towards others, including the review applicant, was an issue that was before the Tribunal; it was an issue about which those representing the review applicant were aware because it was the review applicant who raised it and relied on it; and, in any event, the Tribunal gave those who represented the review applicant notice that whether or not son B was violent was an issue in relation to which the Tribunal might make a finding;  whether the review applicant moved out of the Home to strengthen the visa-applicant’s case for the grant of a Carer visa was not an issue that was before the Tribunal; but, if it was, the Tribunal did not give appropriate notice to those representing the review applicant that it was an issue in relation to which the Tribunal might make a finding; and the Tribunal, therefore, did not fail to comply with s.360(1) of the Act.

       " 'Uddin v Minister for Immigration & Anor [2015] FCCA 1591 (9 June 2015)': '  This is an application for a Constitutional writ within the Court’s jurisdiction under s.476 of the Migration Act 1958 in the respective decision of the Tribunal affirming a decision of the delegate not to grant the applicant a Regional Employer Nomination (Permanent) (Class RN) visa. The grounds of the application are as follows:   1. The member did not apply the law correctly.  2. The member misinterpret the law CL.187.233 of Schedule 2 to the regulation.  On 6 June, the applicant applied to the Department for the visa, which the delegate refused on 9 January 2014.  To be granted the visa, the applicant had to meet a range of criteria under ss.31(3) and 65(1)(a)(ii).  Relevantly, this included cl.187.233 of Schedule 2, which is as follows:    187.233     (1)  The position to which the application relates is the position:   (a)  nominated in an application for approval that seeks to meet the requirements of:   (i)  subparagraph 5.19(4)(h) ii); or   (ii)  subregulation 5.19(4) as in force before 1 July 2012; and   (b)  in relation to which the declaration mentioned in paragraph 1114C(3)(d) of Schedule 1 was made in the application for the grant of the visa.   (2)  The person who will employ the applicant is the person who was the nominator in the application for approval.   (3)  The Minister has approved the nomination.   (4)  The nomination has not subsequently been withdrawn.   (5)  The position is still available to the applicant.   (6)  The application for the visa is made no more than 6 months after the Minister approved the nomination. I note that the term application for approval was defined as “an application under reg.5.19 for approval of the nomination of a position”, pursuant to cl.187.111 of Schedule 2.  Paragraph 114C(3)(d) of Schedule 1 to the regulations provides:  An applicant seeking to satisfy the primary criteria must declare in the application that the position to which the application relates is a position nominated:  (i) under regulation 5.19; or  (ii) in accordance with a labour agreement that is in effect, by an employer that is a party to the labour agreement. The visa application was one where the applicant declared that his visa application pertained to a position was the subject of a nomination of the identifier specified.  That specified identifier referred to an application of nomination which has been made by Wrap & Grill Pty Ltd, and identified the applicant as their nominee in the position of cook.  On 11 December 2013, the department wrote to the applicant and informed him that the Wrap & Grill nomination had been refused.  The letter indicated that as a consequence, the applicant’s visa application could not be approved.  The applicant did not respond to the letter, although invited to do so. On 9 January 2014, the delegate refused the application and observed that on 11 December 2013, the Wrap & Grill nomination had been refused, and accordingly the applicant could not satisfy cl.187.233(3) of Schedule 2 of the Regulations. On 28 January 2014, the applicant sought a review by the Tribunal of the delegate’s decision.  Relevantly, the Tribunal identified the real issue in para.8 as follows:  8.   The issue in the present case is that the nomination related to the visa application has not been approved. It is in these circumstances that the Tribunal found:  11. On the visa application form, the applicant had entered details of the nomination by providing the following Nomination Transaction Reference Number: EGO34WCS22. This reference number relates to the nomination of the position of Cook made by Wrap & Grill Pty Ltd under r.5.19(4)(h)(ii). The application for approval of the position under r.5.19(4)(h)(ii) was not approved by the Department, and that decision was affirmed by this tribunal on 10 February 2015.   12. In response to the tribunal’s invitation to comment on or respond to that information, the applicant’s representative informed the tribunal that the applicant has been sponsored by MS AUS BD PTY LTD. The representative requested that the tribunal await the Department’s decision in relation to the nomination lodged by that business in respect of the applicant and assess this case based on the current nomination. The tribunal considered the request but has decided to proceed to a decision.   13. This is because cl.187.233 requires that any approved position must be the one that was the subject of the declaration that was required to be made as part of the current visa application. The position which was the subject of the declaration made by the applicant was related to the nomination made by Wrap & Grill Pty Ltd (Nomination TRN: EGO34WCS22) which has not been approved, and not a nomination made by MS AUS BD PTY LTD.   14. Therefore, even if the subsequent nomination lodged by a different employer, MS AUS BD PTY LTD, was approved, cl.187.233(1)(b) cannot be met. The visa in relation to this application cannot be granted on the basis of a nomination lodged by a different employer that was not the subject of the visa declaration. The new nomination is not relevant to the application currently before the Tribunal and the Tribunal considers it appropriate to proceed to a decision in these circumstances.  As the nomination made by Wrap & Grill Pty Ltd was not approved, the Tribunal finds that the applicant does not meet the requirements of cl.187.233.  15. The applicant has only sought to satisfy the criteria for a Subclass 187 visa in the Direct Entry stream. No claims have been made in respect of the other visa streams.  As the requirements that must be met by a person seeking the visa in the Direct Entry stream have not been met, the decision under review must be affirmed.  16. The Tribunal affirms the decision not to grant the applicant a Regional Employer Nomination (Permanent) (Class RN) visa. Insofar as ground 1 asserts that the Tribunal did not correctly apply the law, there is nothing in the Tribunal’s reasons or in the Court book that suggests that the Tribunal did not correctly apply the statutory provisions, and there is no substance in relation to ground 1.  The proposition that the Tribunal misinterpreted the Regulations is also one without substance.  The decision of the Tribunal was the only decision to which the Tribunal could come in the facts and the circumstances where the nomination had been refused.  There is no error of law by the Tribunal and the application fails to identify any proper ground for relief. The applicant sought an adjournment.  The adjournment was opposed.  There was no utility in granting an adjournment in circumstances where the proceedings are deemed to failure, as it would only unnecessarily increase the cost to the parties.  I am clearly satisfied these proceedings are doomed to failure, and for that reason the adjournment is refused.  The application is dismissed.I certify that the preceding ten (10) paragraphs are a true copy of the reasons for judgment of Judge Street Associate:  Date:  10 June 2015       ',\n",
       " 'WZAVX v Minister for Immigration & Anor [2015] FCCA 2578 (16 September 2015)': \"  This is an application for a Constitutional writ within the Court’s jurisdiction under s.476 of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) in respect of a decision of the Tribunal made on 12 January 2015 affirming a decision of the delegate not to grant the applicant a protection (class XA) visa.  The application is one in respect of which an extension of time is required under s.477.  Counsel on behalf of the first respondent accepted that there was an adequate explanation advanced by the applicant but maintained that the issue of whether there was a sufficiently arguable ground of jurisdictional error was a reason why an extension of time should not be granted under s.477. The grounds are sufficiently arguable to warrant an extension of time in the interests of the administration of justice. The application identifies four grounds:  1. The Tribunal was in error because it had made the decision in denial of procedural fairness and denial of natural justice to me.  2. The Tribunal had constructively failed to exercise jurisdiction.  Tribunals and other government decision makers must make decisions based on the evidence put before them, and to make a decision based on no evidence is a legal error.  At Paragraph 66 of page 13 of 25 of RRT decision, the Tribunal Member stated that “while the Tribunal accepts that the applicant no longer attends mosque, the Tribunal does not accept that he is a genuine atheist...mosque.) The Tribunal’s finding was that I am not an atheist is based on no evidence.  3. The Tribunal had failed to take into account relevant materials and considerations.  4. Misapplication of the Section 91R(3) of the Migration Act 1958 In addition to those four grounds the applicant’s affidavit in support of the application identified additional grounds as to the applicant’s submissions.  The additional grounds are as follows:  5. The Tribunal failed to set out the reasons for the decision.   6. The Tribunal failed to refer to the evidence or any other material on which the findings of fact were based on.   7. The Tribunal failed to make relevant enquiries into critical facts the existence of which was easily ascertained under Migration Act 1958.   8. The Tribunal made erroneous findings, reached mistaken conclusions on material questions of fact in breach of Section 430 of the Migration Act 1958.   9. The Tribunal failed to engage and invoke Australia's International Obligation under the International Covenant for Civil and Political right (ICCPR) and its second option protocol aiming at the abolition of the Death Penalty and the Covenant against torture.   ...  11. The Tribunal’s decision is irrational, illogical, or so unreasonable that no reasonable decision maker could make it. Paragraph 10 was the same as the applicant had raised as ground 4 in the application. The applicant arrived in Australia on a student visa on 8 July 2004, which was due to expire on 31 January 2006 but which was cancelled on 19 January 2006. After cancellation of the student visa, the applicant was granted a bridging visa which expired on 31 January 2006.  The applicant thereafter remained unlawfully in Australia until located on 16 March 2014 when he was placed in immigration detention, following which he lodged an application for protection on 26 March 2014.  The applicant was found to be a citizen of Bangladesh and his claims were assessed against that country. The applicant claimed fears of being persecuted because of his political opinion and his religious beliefs, by reason of which he said he would be targeted and killed.  The applicant also raised claims of fear of persecution due to his blogs and being an atheist.  The applicant also raised a claim relating to a new law in Bangladesh that he claimed would be used to persecute bloggers.  In his submissions provided to the Tribunal the applicant provided a further statement dated 26 August 2014 and relevantly said in relation to the new law:  I fear the government can arrest me and detain me for a trial under this new law, as I have criticised religion, religious laws, Quran and religious figures many times in my writings and blogs and Facebook.   In response to the first respondent’s submissions and in support of the application the applicant from the Bar table identified in the court book references to his blogs and his picture in relation to certain posts.   This is a case where the Tribunal did not accept the credibility of the applicant and relevantly found:  30. Having considered the applicant's evidence, the Tribunal has formed the view that the applicant is not a witness of truth and considers that the very basis of the applicant's claims to be implausible. ... The applicant contended that the adverse findings of credit were made on observations and not inconsistencies with his evidence.  That is not consistent with the clear reference to inconsistencies raised in the following sentence:  30. ...The Tribunal found the witness to be clearly an intelligent, quick-witted man who is able to explain away inconsistencies put to him. It is clear that the Tribunal took into account the inconsistencies in relation to the applicant’s evidence as well as the other matters identified in para.30 in coming to the finding that the applicant’s overall testimony was unconvincing.  The applicant did provide reasons why he has rehearsed his evidence, given its importance to him, and sought to rely upon a psychologist’s report in relation to his mental health.  It is clear that the Tribunal took into account that expert report at para.27 and the point being made by the Tribunal in the second sentence, which was criticised by the applicant, was that it was a matter for the Tribunal to determine the credibility of the applicant. It was for reasons of want of a finding of credibility in relation to the applicant’s evidence that the delegate had rejected the application.  I do not accept that there is any irrational or inconsistent reasoning in relation to the Tribunal taking into account the psychologist’s report.  The Tribunal noted that it found:  ...The applicant appearing to be expansive and eloquent, addressing a range of general issues while lacking specific detail in his own active participation. It was a finding that was open to the Tribunal, on the material before the Tribunal, and it is clear from the presentation by the applicant in this Court, that he is a highly intelligent, eloquent and clever person.  However, it was matter for the Tribunal to determine the applicant’s credit and relevantly, in that regard, the Tribunal said:  30. ...The Tribunal considers the applicant’s oral and written evidence regarding the reasons why he left Bangladesh, his claims to be an atheist, and his subsequent blogging activities not believable.  After considering all his evidence individually, cumulatively and in its entirety, the Tribunal did not find the applicant credible. That adverse finding cannot be said to lack an evident and intelligible justification and notwithstanding the applicant’s disagreement with the finding by the Tribunal it was an adverse finding it was open on the material before the Tribunal.  In relation to the applicant being an atheist, relevantly the Tribunal said:  64. The Tribunal does not accept the applicant's claim that his uncle will harm him because he is an atheist. The applicant's evidence is that he decided in his late teens that he no longer believed, stopping his attendance at mosque and asking questions about Islam. He claims he was hassled by family members because of his non-attendance. He claims he was called kafir for asking questions and stopping his practise of Islam. The Tribunal does not accept that being called names and hassled for not attending mosque or stopping the practice of Islam amounts to serious harm or significant harm as defined in the Act. The applicant indicates that he remained living in his home area for several more years before moving to Dhaka where he claimed to have only gone out to collect the money sent by his family and to go to and from his tutoring jobs, indicating that be did not attend mosque while in Dhaka either. The applicant's evidence was that he was close to his maternal grandparents and family because he lived with them for several years when he was younger. He indicates that his family were aware that he no longer went to mosque and the Tribunal does not accept that the applicant's uncle was unaware that he was not attending mosque on a regular basis when he resided in Bangladesh based on the claims made by the applicant as to the closeness of his maternal family.  ...   66. While the Tribunal accepts that the applicant no longer attends mosque, the Tribunal does not accept that he is a genuine atheist or that he will face serious harm on his return to \\u2028Bangladesh because he is an atheist and no longer attends mosque. The Tribunal does not accept the applicant's claims that his family were calling him every day, telling him to stay away from western culture and to ask if he was attending mosque because his evidence is that he had ceased going to mosque while living in Bangladesh in his home area where his family were located indicating that they would already be aware that he was not attending mosque on a regular basis. 'The applicant had already been living away from his family for four years prior to his departure for Australia, was not attending mosque or practising his religion and had not experienced any harm. For the reasons as discussed earlier, the Tribunal does not find the applicant a credible witness and does not accept that he told his maternal uncle in 2004 that he was an atheist and does not accept that his brother had to flee because of threats from Islamic extremists because the Tribunal does not accept that his brother was ever threatened by Islamic extremists. The Tribunal does not accept that his uncle will harm him on his return to Bangladesh because he is an atheist as his uncle has not sought to harm him in the past for not practising Islam or attending mosque and the Tribunal does not accept that the applicant is a genuine atheist. The Tribunal does not accept that his uncle has ever threatened to harm him as it does not accept that he told his uncle be was an atheist. The Tribunal does not accept that he will be unable to return to his family as they have continued to support him despite his non-attendance at mosque and failure to practise Islam.  67. The Tribunal does not accept that the applicant will face harm from any family member or any person or extremist group if he returns to Bangladesh because be is an atheist or no longer attends mosque or will be considered to be a Muslim male apostate as he no longer practises Islam or because he no longer believes in being a Muslim and has left Islam. The applicant sought to maintain that there was no rational foundation for the adverse finding in relation to him being a genuine atheist and that he had given evidence about ceasing to attend a mosque.  The adverse findings of credit were a rational and logical basis for the adverse finding by the Tribunal and it is not a matter for this Court to make fresh findings of fact.  This Court does not have jurisdiction to evaluate afresh the applicant’s credit or make fresh findings of fact.   It is also clear that the Tribunal addressed the changes to the laws in Bangladesh that the applicant raised in respect of a fear that he would be arrested, as identified in paras.80 and 93. The applicant, before this Court, advanced that the new law was a specific identified provision which he accepted had not been identified before the Tribunal.  The applicant went further and contended that the specific provision was a discriminatory law that should have been addressed by the Tribunal in terms of his fears of persecution.  I do not accept that the issue of the specific provision as part of the law of Bangladesh being a discriminatory law was raised before the Tribunal or was sufficiently apparent from the material before the Tribunal as to be a claim or integer that the Tribunal should have addressed. The applicant raised a potential inconsistency between paras.85 and 91 in the reasoning of the Tribunal.  The applicant contended that at one point the Tribunal had accepted, in para.91, that he published blogs and that, in para.85, it was suggested the contrary finding had been made.  The Tribunal’s reasons are not to be read with a keen eye for error and are to be read as a whole.  It is apparent, from looking at the whole of para.85, that the Tribunal was addressing the extent of the blogging activities by the applicant in its last sentence.  In paragraph 85 there is a reference to the applicant’s activity in online blogging organisations which is a reference to the claim by the applicant as to the role he had undertaken as an administrator in relation to blogging activities. Paragraph 85 is as follows:  85. The Tribunal found the applicant an intelligent and articulate person, able to provide considerable general information on the Shabagh movement and the blogging movement. Apart from his claims of specific involvement, limited evidence was provided to support his claims. The Tribunal has had regard to the letter he provided as well as copies of his articles and on-line activities, but did not find that these demonstrate or support the applicant’s claims to have been heavily involved. The Tribunal found the limited evidence was provided to support his claimed on-line blogging activities despite the applicant claiming to be heavily involved. The Tribunal finds that the applicant has exaggerated his role to enhance his application for protection. The Tribunal does not accept as credible the applicant’s claims to have been actively involved in blogging or in any on-line blogging organisations or with the Youth Peace and Democracy organisation. The adverse finding by the Tribunal in 85 was open on the material before the Tribunal and I accept the submission of the first respondent that it is not inconsistent with the reasoning addressing the publication of articles on a blog identified in para.91.  The findings in paras.85 and 91 cannot be said to be irrational and illogical so as to give rise to any jurisdictional error. It is clear from attachment A to the Tribunal’s reasons it was expressly incorporated in para.4 that the Tribunal correctly identified the relevant law and, in particular, the role of s.91R in relation to the refugee criterion and separately identified the criterion for complementary protection. Whilst there is a reference in para.91 to the purpose of the applicant in engaging in blogging activities, that purpose was relevant to the reasoning as found as follows:93. The Tribunal has considered the applicant's claims that following changes to the laws in Bangladesh he will be arrested if he returns as he has spoken out through his blogging criticising the actions of the Bangladesh government and religion, supporting the Sahbag movement, demanding war crime justice and this will cause him to be identified to others who wish to harm him. The applicant provided articles and photographs of high profile persons associated with Youth Peace and Democracy in Bangladesh being assaulted as evidence that would also happen to him. The Tribunal does not accept on the evidence provided that the applicant would firstly be identified as the writer and participant in these groups as he has undertaken all his on-line activities, including his Facebook page under the name Tonoy Emroz. Secondly the Tribunal finds that any activity has been limited and he has not achieved the high profile of those he submitted had been targeted by the police. The Tribunal does not accept that the applicant has any interest in his blogging or on-line activities for any other purpose than strengthening his claims to be a refugee and does not accept that he will continue these activities should he return to Bangladesh. The Tribunal therefore does not accept that he will be harmed for these reasons if he returns to Bangladesh.    94. The Tribunal has considered whether the applicant would face a real risk of significant harm as a necessary and foreseeable consequence of his return to Bangladesh if he is identified as an atheist. The Tribunal has considered whether the applicant would face a real risk of significant harm as a necessary and foreseeable consequence of his return to Bangladesh if he is identified as a blogger or because of his membership of various blogging groups or his on-line activities. For the reasons set out above, the Tribunal has not accepted that the applicant will suffer harm for reasons that he is an atheist or that he is opposed to the Bangladesh Government through his blogging activities or membership of various on-line groups or because he no longer attends mosque or practices Islam.   95. In summary, the Tribunal does not accept that the applicant is a credible witness and rejects his claims to fear harm as a result of his political involvement, his on-line blogging activities and membership of various on-line groups such as Youth Peace and Democracy and because he claims to be an atheist and joined various on-line atheist groups.   96. Having considered the applicant's circumstances individually and cumulatively, for the reasons set out above, the Tribunal finds there are no substantial grounds for believing that, as a necessary and foreseeable consequence of the applicant being removed from Australia to Bangladesh, that there is a real risk he will suffer significant harm. The Tribunal is therefore not satisfied that the applicant meets the alternative provisions in s.36(2)(aa). This is not a case where the Court has impermissibly taken into account an irrelevant consideration, being s.91R, in its evaluation of the complementary protection criterion.  The applicant sought to rely upon more recent material subsequent to the decision of the Tribunal, identifying grounds upon which the applicant maintained that he would be killed if he went back to Bangladesh and he identified alleged examples of a blogger being tracked down and killed 15 days after arriving, in front of his wife.  This was not material that was before the Tribunal and, as I have indicated, this Court is not sitting as a court de novo assessing the applicant’s views but has a limited jurisdiction that is focused upon issues of jurisdictional error or a denial of procedural fairness that constitutes a jurisdictional error. The applicant also identified that there were other blogging website activities that he had engaged in that he had not raised before the Tribunal because he could not get access to those websites whilst in detention.  This is not a matter that can give rise to any jurisdictional error and it is clear that the Tribunal gave careful attention to the applicant’s blogs as identified in para.19 as follows:  ...The applicant provided copies of his blogs in support of his claims. The delegate refers to some of the blogs being exactly the same as blogs appearing on other websites yet the applicant has made no claim to blog on any other website. The applicant claims to have commenced his blogging about 2012.  In relation to ground 1 it is clear that the applicant was invited to attend a hearing before the Tribunal on 30 July 2014, consistent with the statutory regime, and did attend that hearing, at which he was represented by his registered migration agent. The applicant had a genuine hearing. Ground 1 is a generalised allegation of a denial of procedural fairness and a denial of natural justice.  The generalised allegations do not make out any sufficiently arguable jurisdictional error. The applicant provided detailed written submissions in relation to the fear raised in respect of political and imputed political opinion and, in substance, disagreed with the adverse findings made by the Tribunal.  That disagreement did not identify any jurisdictional error or any denial of procedural fairness or denial of natural justice.  The applicant also took issue with the Tribunal’s adverse finding in respect of the applicant’s religion and being an atheist.  To the extent that it is suggested the Tribunal did not set out reasons for the adverse findings, I reject that submission. To the extent that it is suggested that the Tribunal did not refer to evidence or other material on which the findings were based, it is clear that the findings were based on the assessment of credit by the applicant and that those adverse findings were available.  To the extent that it is suggested that the finding in this regard was one which lacked a logical foundation, for the reasons I have given, the adverse finding was open in light of the Tribunal’s assessment of credit. The applicant maintained that the Tribunal was biased and had used trickery to ground the decision.  The applicant conveyed that he intended no offence to the Tribunal by raising the allegation of bias.  The Court explained to the applicant it was a perfectly proper allegation for the applicant to raise, however, an allegation of bias must be clearly made and strictly proved.  The applicant referred to the adverse finding in para.64.  An adverse finding is not a basis upon which a fair-minded lay observer might reasonably apprehend that the Tribunal might not bring an independent and impartial mind to the determination of the matter on its merits.  The allegation of bias is not made out.  I reject the submission of trickery.  It is clear that the Tribunal was taking into account the material provided by the applicant and it was entitled to do so in its assessment of the applicant’s credit.  The applicant contended that the Tribunal had ignored relevant country information which was available to the Tribunal and which was more current in relation to the difficulties the applicant was likely to face in respect of his fears in Bangladesh.   In this regard, the applicant contended that the Tribunal had based its decision on country information in 2011.  It is clear, however, from the Tribunal’s reasons that it did take into account country information post 2011 as identified in footnote 2.  This is not a case where it can be said that the Tribunal ignored material current country information that was available to the Tribunal.  No error is made out in relation to the country information to which the Tribunal had regard and I reject the submission that the Tribunal ignored relevant country information. The applicant contended that it was the duty of the Tribunal to research what the applicant contends before this Court were discriminatory laws in Bangladesh.  The reasons I have given, no such discriminatory law issue was raised before the Tribunal, nor was it one that was sufficiently identified that it should have been addressed by the Tribunal.  I accept the first respondent’s submission that the Tribunal was under no duty to make inquiries regarding matters raised by the applicant was it not obliged to make out the applicant’s case for him.  Minister for Immigration and Citizenship v SZGUR (2011) HCA 1 at 20:  Prasad v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs [1985] FCA 47;  (1985) 6 FCR 155 at 169-170.  I repeat in this regard the proposition of a discriminatory law was not raised by the applicant. No denial of procedural fairness or denial of natural justice is made out in relation to the adverse findings in respect to the applicant’s religion and the applicant’s claim as to being an atheist.  The applicant maintained that he had suffered events that constituted torture, threats or humiliation.  The applicant identified in this Court the evidence to which he had referred in respect of those events.  I accept the first respondent’s submission that the Tribunal accepted the applicant may have been assaulted in December 2001 but found this assault was because of generalised violence occurring in Bangladesh at the time and not indicative of persecution.  See para.57. The Tribunal did not accept that the applicant had been tortured and his claims to persecution in that regard were rejected.  That adverse finding was open on the material before the Tribunal.  The Tribunal did not deny the applicant procedural fairness or deny the applicant natural justice in relation to the adverse findings in respect of torture.  In relation to the applicant’s blogging and online activities, it is clear that the Tribunal carefully addressed those matters.  I do not accept the applicant’s contention that the Tribunal failed to understand the features of Facebook or reach mistaken conclusions or asked itself a wrong question in relation to the applicant’s blogging, so far as having an impact on credibility findings. I do not accept that the Tribunal did not take into account the evidence advanced by the applicant.  I do not accept that the Tribunal ignored the photographs and name of the applicant on the articles and I do not accept that the Tribunal ignored the evidence of the applicant in relation to the blog specified by the application.  I do not accept that the Tribunal’s adverse conclusion in relation to the applicant’s blogging and the extent of that blogging was not open on the material before the Tribunal. I do not accept that the Tribunal made contradictory findings in relation to the blogging by the applicant I do not accept that there are any identified relevant considerations to which the Tribunal failed to have regard in relation to the adverse findings on blogging.  In relation to the applicant’s claim for protection as a refugee, I do not accept that the Tribunal failed to consider any relevant matter in applying s.91R(3). I do not accept that the Tribunal failed to take into account the applicant’s alleged claims of fear because of his criticism of Islam and advocating secularism.  There was no denial of procedural fairness or denial of natural justice relating to the Tribunal’s adverse findings in relation to the applicant’s blogging and online activities. In relation to the applicant’s credibility, I do not accept that the adverse findings were based on unfairness, erroneous assumptions or a lack of partiality.  For the reasons I have given, the adverse findings were open and the adverse findings are not a basis upon which any allegation of bias can be made out.  I do not accept that the Tribunal made erroneous or mistaken conclusions or lacked an understanding of the evidence in the making of the adverse findings, or did not take into account the applicant’s evidence.  I do not accept that the Tribunal asked itself the wrong question in relation to the applicant’s evidence and the adverse finding, for the reasons I have identified, in respect of the applicant’s credibility was open. The adverse findings of the Tribunal in relation to the applicant’s credibility are not ones that give rise to any denial of procedural fairness or a denial of natural justice in relation to the applicant.  In relation to s.91R(3), I do not accept that the Tribunal asked itself the wrong questions and I have not accepted that the Tribunal did not consider the applicant’s evidence.  I reject the submission that the Tribunal did not consider the applicant’s evidence in relation to the involvement of the applicant in the blogging and his role or in determining his profile for the reasons I have given.  The issue of a discriminatory law was not raised before the Tribunal and was not one which the Tribunal should have addressed on the material before the Tribunal. It is clear that the Tribunal did address the applicant’s fears in respect of the persecution of atheists and secular bloggers.  I do not accept that the Tribunal denied the applicant procedural fairness or denied the applicant natural justice in the adverse finding in relation to s.91R.  To the extent that the applicant sought to identify a want of tendering of material by the migration agent, that is not a basis upon which any jurisdictional error can be made out, see SZFDE v Minister of Immigration and Citizenship [2007] HCA 35;  (2007) 232 CLR 189 at  [53] and Mellick v Minister for Immigration [2013] FCCA 1134 at  [23].  Ground 1 of the application accordingly is not made out. In relation to ground 2, the adverse finding in relation to the applicant’s religion and alleged state of being an atheist is not one in respect of which there was any constructive failure of Tribunal to exercise jurisdiction.  This was an area which was open to the Tribunal to make adverse findings.  Ground 2 fails to make out any jurisdictional error.  In relation to ground 3, the generalised assertion of the failure to take into account relevant matters, is not capable of making out a jurisdictional error, for the reasons I have given.  There was no jurisdictional error of the kind identified in para.3.  In relation to ground 4, it is clear that the Tribunal properly identified the relevant law in relation to s.91R and there is nothing to identify any misapplication of s.91R(3) by the Tribunal.  Relevantly the Tribunal held:  86. The Tribunal discussed with the applicant the provisions of s91R(3) and was told that he did blogging because he was interested in politics and it had nothing to do with a protection visa application. It was submitted that the applicant had joined these groups prior to his application for protection being lodged or contemplated and therefore s91(R)(3) does not apply. The applicant told the Tribunal that he joined these online groups in 2012 because of his continuing interest in Bangladesh politics and because he is an atheist and opposes the Islamic groups. He told the Tribunal that be joined in 2012 after looking at another group at the end of 2011. For the reasons as discussed earlier, the Tribunal has not accepted the applicant' s claims to have maintained an interest in Bangladesh politics and does not accept his claim that it was his interest that caused him to seek out on-line groups and become involved in blogging as well as participate in the on-line group Youth Peace and Democracy. The applicant told the Tribunal that from about 2005 he had discussed with his former flatmate and friends about applying for protection but they told him he had left it too late. The applicant had been unlawful in Australia since January 2006 and was aware of the possibility that he may at some stage be detained or that he may have to resolve his visa status. The Tribunal is satisfied that the applicant's sole purpose in starting blogging activities as well as joining on-line atheist groups was to support an application for protection. As the Tribunal has determined that the applicant's sole purpose in blogging and joining on-line atheist and political groups was to strengthen his refugee claims, the Tribunal must disregard this conduct when considering his well-founded fear of persecution on this basis. \\u2028  87. After considering the available evidence, the Tribunal finds that there is not a real chance the applicant would be harmed by the government and/or the authorities and/or any political party and/or anyone associated with any political party and/or any member of his family and or any extremist political or religions group now or in in the reasonably foreseeable future if be returns to Bangladesh for any Convention ground. \\u202888. The Tribunal has considered all the applicant's the claims individually, cumulatively and in entirety and finds that the applicant does not have a well-founded fear of persecution for a Convention reason if he returns to Bangladesh now or in the reasonably foreseeable future.   No jurisdictional error is made out in relation to ground 4.  In relation to the other grounds raised by the applicant, the assertion that the Tribunal failed to set out the reasons for the decision in ground 5 does not make out any jurisdictional error. For the reasons I have given, it is clear that the adverse findings by the Tribunal were open and there was no failure by the Tribunal to provide reasons for its adverse findings. In relation to ground 6, the generalised assertion of a failure to refer to evidence and material upon which the findings were based, fails to make out any jurisdictional error.  For the reasons I have earlier identified, nothing in the applicant’s submissions identifies any adverse finding that was not open on the material before the Tribunal.  In relation to ground 7, the generalised assertion of a requirement to make inquiries into critical facts is misconceived and does not identify any jurisdictional error.  In relation to ground 8, there was no breach of the Tribunal’s duty under s.430 and the adverse findings were open and no jurisdictional error of the kind identified in ground 8 is made out. Ground 9 fails to identify any jurisdictional error and is in substance an attempt to agitate the merits of the matter, which was within the domain of the Tribunal.  In relation to ground 11, the adverse findings by the Tribunal cannot be said to lack an evident and intelligible justification.  Ground 11 does not make out any jurisdictional error.  The application is dismissed.  I certify that the preceding forty (40) paragraphs are a true copy of the reasons for judgment of Judge StreetAssociate:  Date: 23 September 2015       \",\n",
       " 'Wickramasinghe & Anor v Minister for Immigration & Anor [2015] FCCA 3008 (23 October 2015)': '  These reasons for judgment were delivered orally.  They have been corrected from the transcript.  Grammatical errors have been corrected and an attempt has been made to render the orally delivered reasons amenable to being read. This is an application for a show cause hearing pursuant to r.44.12 of the Federal Circuit Court Rules 2001 (Cth).  The applicant attended today with legal representation.  Her legal representative did not file a notice of address for service and did not notify the Court or the Minister that he would be appearing today, which means the Court unnecessarily incurred the expense of having an interpreter attend Court today to assist the applicant. The Court provides interpreters for unrepresented litigants, not litigants who are legally represented. The applicant’s lawyer sought an adjournment of today’s proceeding.  The adjournment was refused because the application was filed on 24 December 2014, directions were made on 15 April 2015 listing the matter for a show cause hearing and, in fact, originally, the show cause hearing was listed for 2 October 2015.  Due to the public holiday on 2 October 2015, the hearing was postponed until today, 23 October 2015.  In those circumstances, the applicant had ample time to seek legal advice, to put material before the Court and to seek a transcript of the proceedings. When considering whether or not to grant an adjournment application, the Court has to consider not just the implications for this case, but for case management generally, and the impact that adjournments have on the management of the Court’s docket and other cases, and in this regard I refer to AON Risk Management Services Ltd v Australian National University  (2009) 239 CLR 175. The Minister opposed the adjournment and I refused to grant the adjournment. The applicant says that the Tribunal decision was unreasonable.  It is quite clear that there was a single issue before the Tribunal.  It is also clear that this issue had been specifically identified by the Delegate in the Delegate’s decision made on 1 May 2014. Clause 5A404 of the Migration Regulations 1994 (Cth) deals with English language proficiency. It is set out as follows:  The applicant must give evidence that one of the following applies:  (a) the applicant:  (i) will not undertake an ELICOS before commencing his or her principal course; and  (ii) achieved, in an IELTS test that was taken less than 2 years before the date of the application, an Overall Band Score of at least 5.5;  (b) the applicant:  (i) will undertake an ELICOS of no more than 20 weeks duration before commencing his or her principal course; and  (ii) achieved, in an IELTS test that was taken less than 2 years before the date of the application, an Overall Band Score of at least 5.0;  (c) the applicant:  (i) is fully funded; and  (ii) has a level of English language proficiency that satisfies his or her proposed education provider; and  (iii) if the applicant is to undertake an ELICOS before commencing his or her principal course—will undertake an ELICOS of no more than 20 weeks duration;  (d) the applicant had, less than 2 years before the date of the application:  (i) successfully completed the requirements for a Senior Secondary Certificate of Education, in a course that was conducted:  (A) in Australia; and   (B) in English; or  (ii) successfully completed the requirements for a Senior Secondary Certificate of Education, in a course that:  (A) is specified by the Minister in an instrument in writing for this subsubparagraph; and   (B) was conducted outside Australia; and  (C) was conducted in English; or  (iii) as the holder of a student visa—successfully completed a substantial part of a course (other than a foundation course) that:  (A) was conducted in English; and  (B) was leading to a qualification from the Australian Qualifications Framework at the Certificate IV level or higher; or   (iv) successfully completed a substantial part of a course that:  (A) is specified by the Minister in an instrument in writing for this subsubparagraph; and   (B) was conducted outside Australia; and  (C) was conducted in English; and  (D) was leading to a qualification from the Australian Qualifications Framework at the Certificate IV level or higher; or  (v) successfully completed a foundation course that was conducted:  (A) in Australia; and   (B) in English; or  (vi) successfully completed a course in foundation studies that:  (A) is specified by the Minister in an instrument in writing for this subsubparagraph; and   (B) was conducted outside Australia; and  (C) was conducted in English;  (e) the applicant achieved, less than 2 years before the date of the application, the required score in a test that is specified in a Gazette Notice under clause 5A102;  (f) the applicant has:  (i) a level of English language proficiency that satisfies the applicant’s proposed education provider; and  (ii) at least 5 years of study in English undertaken in 1 or more of the following countries:  (A) Australia;  (B) Canada;  (C) New Zealand;  (D) South Africa;  (E) the Republic of Ireland;       (F) the United Kingdom;       (G) the United States of America. There is no doubt that in this case, the applicant had completed the IELTS test within the appropriate timeframe and that she had achieved an overall band score of 5, which means that 5A404(b) applied.  The provision refers to, in the introduction to the provision as a whole:The applicant must give evidence that one of the following applies...  That is mandatory.  There’s no discretion about that.  The applicant satisfied subsection (b)(ii).  The issue is with respect to subsection (b)(i), which says:  ...will undertake an ELICOS of no more than 20 weeks duration before commencing his or her principal course. The applicant was on notice from the Delegate decision as to what the issue was with respect to her visa application.  I also note, at Court Book page 139, that again, the Tribunal had written to her, referring to the issue. The applicant applied for a review to the Tribunal.  The applicant was invited to attend the Tribunal and to give evidence, which she did.  The applicant had the assistance of a migration agent at the Tribunal hearing.  At the Tribunal hearing, the applicant said that the Delegate had overlooked the fact that she had completed a 20 week course of English study in Australia.  The migration agent submitted that that satisfied the visa requirements, and at paragraph 13, the Tribunal member says:  “The Tribunal explained that the requirement is that the applicant will undertake an ELICOS of no more than 20 weeks and achieved at least 5.0 in a relevant IELTS test.  The Tribunal said the applicant has not provided evidence that she will undertake an ELICOS, rather, she has provided evidence that she has undertaken an ELICOS”. It is clear from that paragraph that the Tribunal member raised the issue with the applicant at the hearing.  There is nothing on the face of the decision that indicates that the applicant sought an adjournment in order to put on evidence about that requirement. Paragraph 20 is also significant and says:  “As discussed above, she provided the Tribunal with evidence that she undertook the ELICOS courses in Australia in 2010 and 2011.  She did not give evidence that she will undertake an ELICOS of no more than 20 weeks’ duration before commencing her principal course.  The Tribunal therefore finds that she does not satisfy clause 5A404(b) of Schedule 5A. The applicant’s lawyer submits that the applicant is a genuine student and had shown a commitment to undertaking the course, because she had undertaken the course previously. It is very clear that in the area of migration, it is a technical area of law and the legislation, whilst complex, clearly spells out the requirement for the applicant to satisfy that visa.  It is not a matter of discretion and there was no ambiguity in that clause, and it cannot be said that the applicant was not on notice that that was the issue.  The applicant relies on the decisions of Rana v Minister for Immigration and Anor [2009] FMCA 553, and refers to paragraph 36 in particular, where Cameron FM, as he then was, refers to this second step as being a commitment to undertake or not undertake that course once the result of the IELTS test is known.  However, paragraph 38 then refers to making the ELICOS undertaking. The fact is, when looking at the provision of the regulation, it makes clear that it is mandatory to provide evidence of the undertaking.  It is not about showing a commitment to giving an undertaking, but providing evidence. The fact that she had done the course in the past, cannot be surmised as automatically meaning she has a commitment to doing it in the future.  It was a simple issue. Furthermore, paragraph 24 of the Federal Court decision of Patel v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship  [2012] FCA 376 also makes this requirement in the regulation very clear, at paragraph 24:  “Further, the Federal Magistrate did not err in finding that the Tribunal had correctly applied cl 5A404(b). This clause requires a visa applicant with an Overall Band Score of 5.0 on the IELTS test, to provide evidence that he or she “will undertake” the relevant ELICOS course. It does not, therefore, avail a visa applicant to provide evidence that he or she has already undertaken such a course. The rationale for this sequence is somewhat elusive, but the construction of the requirement is clear, and Mrs Patel did not satisfy the requirement. Also, the Federal Magistrate did not err in relation to his finding that the department had advised Mrs Patel of the cl 5A404 requirements.” In those circumstances, any complaint that the decision of the Tribunal was unreasonable cannot stand.  It is necessary, in these matters, to look closely at what the actual evidence was before the Tribunal and what the Tribunal actually said, as well as the requirements of the specific regulations that apply.  It is not a matter where it is possible for this Court to find a jurisdictional error based on broader considerations or submissions that are not founded or grounded in the specific legislative requirements. I find that the applicant has not raised an arguable case and therefore, I will dismiss the application pursuant to r.44.12 of the Federal Circuit Court Rules. The applicants are to pay the first respondent’s costs.I certify that the preceding eighteen (18) paragraphs are a true copy of the reasons for judgment of Judge HarlandAssociate:  Date:  9 November 2015       ',\n",
       " 'Zupancic v Minister for Immigration & Anor [2015] FCCA 1433 (17 June 2015)': ' Background  The applicant in these proceedings is a citizen of Slovenia who arrived in Australia on a Student TU visa which expired on 2 December 2012. At some time shortly after that date, the applicant applied for another student visa. However, that application had not been considered when, in October 2013, the applicant suffered a workplace injury that required a number of surgical operations.  On 30 April 2014 the applicant provided a police certificate to an officer of the Department of Immigration together with a medical report in connection with his injuries and treatment. The officer replied to the applicant the following day indicating that in order to obtain a student visa he would have to be enrolled in a course and to study in Australia. The officer indicated that in the applicant’s case there were three options available:  1. You enrol to a course and provide us your new COEs, OSHC and medical check clearance; or  2. You withdraw your current application and apply for another type of visa more suitable for your situation / or leave this country after withdraw your application; or  3. You will not do anything and keep silent, then we will finalize this application The applicant responded in turn, saying:  As you recommended me, I applied for medical visa which is more suitable to my situation, because of my surgery and medical treatment. Couple of days ago I was personally at immigration office, where I filled in application for medical visa, and I got all needed papers from my doctor and hospital where I am treated, to fulfil application. The officer responded to this message as follows:  Thanks for the email. If you want to withdraw your student visa application, please indicate clearly by replying to this email. Please be noted that we did not recommend you anything, but only let you know the options you have for your application. Please be also aware that the application fee you paid for your student visa application is not refundable nor transferable according to the legislations. The applicant then wrote to the officer indicating that he did wish to withdraw his student visa application because he had already sent documents for a medical visa to the Department “as it was recommended to me at immigration office.” On 12 May 2014 the applicant lodged an application for a Medical Treatment (Visitor) (Class UB) visa. What the applicant did not appear to realise is that it was a condition for the grant of that visa that the application for it was validly made within 28 days after the relevant day, meaning the day on which to he ceased to hold a substantive visa: sub-cl.602.213(5) of sch.2 and sub-cl.3001(c)(i) of sch.3 to the Migration Regulations 1994 (“Regulations”). The last substantive visa held by the applicant was his student visa which expired on 2 December 2012. On that basis, the application was never going to be successful. On 14 May 2014 a delegate of the first respondent (“Minister”) decided to refuse to grant the applicant a visa on the basis that the application had been made more than 28 days after the relevant day. The applicant applied to the second respondent (“Tribunal”) for review of that decision. In support of his application for review, the applicant provided the Tribunal with a number of documents relating to his workplace injury and his rehabilitation treatment and return to work plan. The applicant attended a hearing at the Tribunal and asked it to take evidence from two witnesses concerning his injuries. The Tribunal did not accede to that request because the relevant evidence of those witnesses only went to the applicant’s medical issues which, it said, were not in dispute. The applicant provided the Tribunal with photographs of his home country including those of his wife, son and extended family and explained that he wished to finalise his medical treatment arising from his injury and that he would then return to his family. The Tribunal found that the application was not made within 28 days after the expiry of his last held substantive visa and, for that reason, cl.3001(1) was not satisfied and in turn the cl.602.213 of sch.2 to the Regulations was not satisfied. For that reason the Tribunal affirmed the decision of the delegate to refuse to grant the applicant a visa. Extension of Time  The applicant now wishes to seek judicial review of the Tribunal’s decision. In accordance with s.477 of the Migration Act 1958 (“Act”), such an application to this Court had to be made within 35 days of the date of the Tribunal’s decision. The date of the decision was the date of the written notice of the decision, namely 22 October 2014: sub-s.477(3)(b). Therefore any application under s.476 had to be made on or before 26 November 2014. The application was only made some four months later on 31 March 2015. This Court has power under s.477(2) of the Act to extend the 35 day period as it considers appropriate if:  a) an application for that order has been made in writing to the Federal Circuit Court specifying why the applicant considers that it is necessary in the interests of the administration of justice to make the order; and  b) the Federal Circuit Court is satisfied that it is necessary in the interests of the administration of justice to make the order. There was no issue that the first of these preconditions had been met.  In SZRIQ v Minister for Immigration & Citizenship [2013] FCA 1284;  (2013) 139 ALD 252 Foster J dealt with an application for judicial review of a decision of this Court refusing to extend the time under s.477(2). His Honour explained the matters relevant to an application under s.477(2) as follows:  [46] There are no particular criteria specified in s 477 which must be satisfied as part of the concept of “the interests of the administration of justice ...”.  The matters which might be taken into account by the Federal Magistrates Court are at large although they must logically and sensibly relate to the interests of the administration of justice.   [47] The courts have developed guidelines as to the factors which might ordinarily be taken into account in considering the interests of the administration of justice in this context.  Commonly, those factors include:  (a) Whether there has been a reasonable and adequate explanation for the applicant’s delay;  (b) Whether there is any prejudice to the Minister;  (c) Whether the applicant’s substantive case for judicial review is sufficiently arguable to justify the extension of time.   [48] The factors to which I have referred at [47] above, although commonly deployed by judges when considering extensions of time of the character under consideration in the present case, are not prescribed under the relevant statutory provision (s 477(2)(b) of the Act) and cannot be said to exhaust all potentially relevant factors in every case.  They are simply sensible guidelines developed by the courts which have utility in most cases. In SZNZI v Minister for Immigration [2010] FMCA 57 Smith FM said this about the Court’s discretion to extend time under s.477(2):  [11] The considerations which might bear on that discretion are unconfined. As with other powers to extend time and to waive defaults in relation to court procedures, two “critical” considerations are: “(1) that an explanation, reasonable to the circumstances, is provided for the party’s absence or other default; and (2) that the party in default has a material argument which, if heard and decided on its merits, might reasonably affect the determination of the rights and duties of the parties in a way different from that in the impugned order” (see Kirby J in Allesch v Maunz  (2000) 203 CLR 172 at [48]). Other considerations may come into play, including in my opinion, the implications of the appeals structure and alternative judicial review avenues (see Yu v Minister for Immigration  [2009] FMCA 1161 at  [40]–[41]). None of the relevant considerations should be elevated to being a necessary consideration in all cases, including the two “critical” considerations (see Adams v Kennick Trading (International) Ltd (1986) 4 NSWLR 503 at 506 and 510). When reaching its ultimate conclusion, the Court must weigh all of the relevant circumstances together by reference to the statutory criterion provided in s 477(2)(b), quoted above. Reasons for delay  It is convenient to deal first with the reasons given by the applicant for his delay in bringing these proceedings. In his application, the applicant said:  Medical grounds. I am scheduled to have surgery in April for shoulder and another one on 03rd of June 2015 for knees. Enclosed are the other copies confirming my surgery dates. While making arrangements to lodge my case via the channels suggested by immigration assistance (Immigration Dept) my papers were never lodged by Law Society of NSW on pro bono scheme and I was informed after the due date was passed by above mentioned organisation that they can’t handle my case, in turn making me an unlawful citizen and being detained at Villawood. My grievance is caused by official immigration assistance information provided by DIMA and Law Society of NSW which never lodged my papers. In an affidavit made in support of the application the applicant also gave the following reasons:  After receiving letter from MRT (Migration Review Tribunal) dated 22nd October 2014, outlining their decision, which I consider to be reviewed as the new development in my medical record that can authenticate my claims.  I contacted Law Society of NSW under pro bono scheme as directed by the immigration assistance for further appeals. Mr Ben from Law Society asked me to submit all papers concerning my case and they will refer the case to prospective lawers (sic). I duly lodged my papers well within my deadline in their offices on Phillip St, Sydney. Unfortunately for some reason my documents/application was not lodged as per schedule as my case was sent to Legal Aid and they declined and was again sent back to them for necessary action.  This process of Law Society and Legal Aid took so much time that my deadline passed with me no knowledge and under the impression that my application has been lodged and I am waiting for court date to pursue my case.  When I was called in by immigration office I presented myself in to their office with confidence thinking my case is in courts and I have legal status. I have been brought into detention centre because of the lengthy process of Law Society NSW and its sister concerns.  On the reasons above I would like to request to grant me an extension to file for appeal and accept my attached application for necessary action and oblige. At the hearing before me, the applicant tendered a letter from him to the Law Society pro bono scheme dated 24 November 2014 referring to information that had been sent to it a week earlier. I accept that the applicant took reasonable steps to obtain legal representation in order to assist him with his claim for judicial review of the Tribunal’s decision. I also accept his evidence that he understood, for whatever reason, that he did not have to take any further steps in order to bring these proceedings. It is not necessary for me to determine whether that understanding was made on the basis of incorrect advice by the Law Society or simply by reason of his having misunderstood what was said to him. The fact is that there is a reasonable basis given by the applicant for his delay in bringing these proceedings. Prospects of success  At the hearing, I explained to the applicant that he also had to address whether or not there were any prospects of succeeding on the application, in other words, whether there was any legal error in the Tribunal’s decision. In this respect, the applicant relied upon the correspondence between himself and the Department which is referred to at [2] to [5] above. He said that he had relied on what the officer told him in withdrawing his student visa application and making an application for the medical treatment visa. If he had not done so, he might have been eligible for the student visa and would have been able to undertake the medical treatment that he required as result of his workplace injury. The Minister submitted that the officer was only responding to an enquiry made by the applicant and did not give any advice upon which the applicant could reasonably rely. Further, even on the assumption that the applicant was somehow misled by the Department, which was not conceded, there could be no jurisdictional error in the Tribunal’s decision simply because the fact remained that the applicant could not satisfy the criteria for the grant of the medical treatment visa. The real basis for the applicant’s complaint is that it is unfair to him to have been denied a visa in circumstances where he considered that he was simply following the advice of the Department of Immigration. Certainly, from the applicant’s viewpoint, the outcome of his visa application was unfair. I accept that he understood that an officer of the Department of Immigration suggested to him that a medical treatment visa was more suitable to his circumstances than a student visa. However, that was undeniably true: the applicant was not studying, he was not enrolled to study in any particular course, and there is no evidence before me to suggest that he intended to study. That might be because he was injured and his focus had changed to rehabilitation; however, it does not change the accuracy of what was said by the Department. Further, there is no suggestion that the officer of the Department with whom the applicant was in correspondence was ever aware that the applicant’s last substantive visa had expired some considerable time earlier. In light of that, even if the outcome was, speaking colloquially, unfair, the responsibility for that unfairness cannot be sheeted home to the Department of Immigration. The officer of the Department made it clear in the correspondence that he had made no recommendation to the applicant. In light of that, although the applicant appeared to have been acting in good faith, his reliance upon what he was told by the Department as a recommendation by it was not reasonable in the circumstances. Even if it were to be concluded that some administrative unfairness had been visited upon the applicant by reason of what was said by the officer of the Department, that would not necessarily give rise to any ground of review in this Court in respect of the Tribunal’s decision. The power of this Court is limited to the correction of jurisdictional error, that is, that the Tribunal failed to observe an inviolable limitation on its jurisdiction Further, given that there is no allegation of dishonesty, the highest that the applicant’s claim can go is that there arose some type of estoppel by reason of the representations made by the officer of the Department. However, as explained by Gummow J in Minister for Immigration Local Government & Ethnic Affairs v Kurtovic [1990] FCA 22;  (1990) 21 FCR 193 at 209, there is no estoppel effective against the operation of a statute: see more recently Smith v Boné, in the matter of ACN 002 864 002 Pty Ltd (in liq) [2015] FCA 319 and Minister for Health v Nicholl Holdings Pty Ltd [2015] FCAFC 73 at  [50] referring to the cases of Kurtovic, Webb Distributors (Aust) Pty Ltd v Victoria [1993] HCA 61;  (1993) 179 CLR 15 at 38, Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Wade [1951] HCA 66;  (1951) 84 CLR 105 at 117 per Kitto J, and Formosa v Secretary, Department of Social Security [1988] FCA 291;  (1988) 46 FCR 117 at 125. In addition, it is difficult to see how the conduct of an officer of the Department could possibly have affected the exercise of jurisdiction by the Tribunal. This Court relevantly only has jurisdiction in respect of the latter: see Prodduturi v Minister for Immigration & Border Protection  (2015) 144 ALD 243.  For those reasons, the only ground raised by the applicant has no prospects of success. Other issues  In addition to the reasons for delay and the prospects of success, I have taken into account the fact that the applicant has no right to appeal from a judgment refusing to extend the period under s.477(2) of the Act. The applicant also relied on the fact that he wished to remain in Australia only in order to undertake rehabilitation from a workplace injury suffered here and that after he had done so, he wished to return to his family in Slovenia. I cannot see, however, that that consideration is relevant to the exercise of discretion under s.477(2) as, in reality, it appears only to be focused upon the genuineness of his application for the medical treatment visa growing rather than having anything to do with the proceedings before the Court. Conclusion  Although I accept that the applicant has provided a reasonable excuse for the delay in bringing these proceedings, and note that he will be unable to appeal this decision, in my view, it is important that there is no prospect of him succeeding on judicial review and the consequence that there is little if any utility in granting an extension of the time within which to bring these proceedings. For those reasons, I am not satisfied that it is necessary in the interests of the administration of justice to extend the period within which an application under s.476 of the Act might be made. I dismiss the application.I certify that the preceding twenty-eight (28) paragraphs are a true copy of the reasons for judgment of Judge SmithAssociate:  Date: 17 June 2015       '}"
