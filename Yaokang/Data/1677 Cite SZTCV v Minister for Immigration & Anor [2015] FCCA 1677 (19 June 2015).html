<ol>
<li style='text-indent:0pt; margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt;' value='1' value="1"><a name="Heading103"></a>This
is an application filed in this Court on 25 July 2013 under the <i><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ma1958118/" class="autolink_findacts">Migration Act
1958</a> </i>(Cth) (the &#8220;<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ma1958118/" class="autolink_findacts">Migration Act</a>&#8221;) seeking judicial review of
a decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal (the &#8220;Tribunal&#8221;), being
RRT Case Number
1300991, a decision of Tribunal Member P. McIntosh dated 26 June
2013, affirming the decision of a delegate of the Minister for Immigration
and
Border Protection (the &#8220;Minister&#8221;) to refuse to grant the applicant
a Protection (Class XA) visa.</li>
<li style='text-indent:0pt; margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt;' value='2' value="2">The
solicitors for the Minister filed on 2 September 2013 a folder which was
indexed, labelled and paginated, containing all documents
which may be relevant
to the hearing. The volume of material provided has been identified as the Court
Book (&#8220;CB&#8221;) and
marked as Exhibit &#8220;A&#8221;.   </li>
<li style='text-indent:0pt; margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt;' value='3' value="3">The
applicant was granted leave on 11 September 2013 to file and serve any amended
application, affidavit evidence, written submissions
or list of authorities upon
which he sought to rely.  The applicant filed:<ol type="a">
<li style='text-indent:0pt; margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt;' value='1'>An
amended application on 27 September 2013; and</li>
<li style='text-indent:0pt; margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt;' value='2'>A
further amended application on 30 May 2014.  No leave was granted for the filing
of the further amended application and the Minister
opposed the granting of such
leave.  This is addressed below.</li></ol></li></ol>
<p class="h2"><b>Background</b></p>
<ol>
<li style='text-indent:0pt; margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt;' value='4' value="4"><a name="Heading109"></a>In
setting out the following background material I have quoted directly from the
Court Book and submissions prepared by the parties.
I have not made further
attribution as this would make the summary unwieldy. Where this information is
extracted from the Court Book,
each item contains a reference (&#8220;CB&#8221;)
for that material.</li>
<li style='text-indent:0pt; margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt;' value='5' value="5">The
applicant is a citizen of Sri Lanka who arrived on Christmas Island on 20 June
2012 (CB 85.3).  On 18 September 2012 the applicant
was informed that the
Minister had exercised his power under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ma1958118/s46a.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.46A(2)</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ma1958118/" class="autolink_findacts">Migration Act</a><i> </i>to
allow the applicant to apply for a protection visa (CB 5).  The applicant
applied for the visa on 18 September 2012 (CB 1-61).
 The delegate refused the
visa on 13 February 2013 (CB 80-101).  The applicant applied to the Tribunal for
review on 20 February
2013 (CB 102-177).  The Tribunal held a hearing on 12
April 2013 (CB 203-205).</li>
<li style='text-indent:0pt; margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt;' value='6' value="6">The
applicant claimed to fear persecution in Sri Lanka because of his Tamil
ethnicity and suspected involvement with the LTTE.  He
claimed to have been born
in 1995 in Mallaithivu, a LTTE stronghold during the civil war.  He claimed that
he was stopped and searched
by soldiers on his way to school during the civil
war, and that in 2010 and 2011 soldiers had visited his home and registered the
occupants.  He claimed that in 2012 men in plainclothes visited his house and
questioned the occupants.  He claimed that he was not
mistreated, but was
frightened and left Sri Lanka with a stepbrother in June 2012 (CB 219-222 at
[23]-[47]).  The Tribunal found
that the applicant was not of any particular
interest to the authorities, and rejected his claims to fear harm as a member of
an
alleged particular social group of &#8220;<i>failed asylum seekers</i>&#8221;
(CB 223-225 [48]-[61]).</li>
<li style='text-indent:0pt; margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt;' value='7' value="7">The
Tribunal also considered the possibility that the applicant might be charged
with illegal departure from Sri Lanka.  The Tribunal
found that while it was
possible that the Applicant might be detained for up to three nights in
&#8220;<i>cramped and unpleasant circumstances</i>&#8221; before being bailed,
this would not amount to systematic and discriminatory conduct within
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ma1958118/s91r.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.91R(1)(c)</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ma1958118/" class="autolink_findacts">Migration Act</a> (CB 226 at [64]), or be &#8220;<i>significant
harm</i>&#8221; within the &#8220;<i>complementary protection</i>&#8221;
provisions in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ma1958118/s36.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.36(2)(aa)</a> of the Act (CB 226-227 at [69]-[73]).</li></ol>

<ol>
<li style='text-indent:0pt; margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt;' value='8' value="8"><a name="Heading114"></a>Leave
was sought at the final hearing by the applicant to file a further amended
application, which was opposed by the Minister. 
Notwithstanding, the
Minister&#8217;s representatives had prepared submissions to address the added
ground proposed to be relied
upon by the applicant.  Accordingly, leave was
granted for the filing of the further amended application.</li>
<li style='text-indent:0pt; margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt;' value='9' value="9">The
further amended application pleads the following grounds of
review:<ul type="none">
<li style='text-indent:0pt; margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt;'"><i>	1.	The RRT
erred in its understanding of the applicable law on what was degrading treatment
or punishment and cruel or inhuman treatment

failed to address the correct test when it made a finding on whether the

would face on being detained in Sri Lanka was degrading
treatment or punishment or was cruel or inhuman treatment or
punishment.</i></li>
<li style='text-indent:0pt; margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt;'"><i>	2.	The RRT
failed to comply with Ministerial Direction Number 56 in contravention of

<ol>
<li style='text-indent:0pt; margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt;' value='10' value="10"><a name="Heading127"></a>The
applicant contends that the Tribunal&#8217;s findings as to complimentary
protection are infected with jurisdictional error. The
applicant seeks the leave
of the Court to file a further amended application in the form annexed to these
submissions.</li>
<li style='text-indent:0pt; margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt;' value='11' value="11">The
applicant made claims that he feared significant harm in Sri Lanka as a
returning failed Tamil asylum seeker. He claimed he would
face incarceration on
his return.</li>
<li style='text-indent:0pt; margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt;' value='12' value="12">The
applicant&#8217;s adviser submitted reports as to the overcrowding and lack of
sanitation in the Sri Lankan prison system generally.
 This included the
following from a  UNCAT report (CB 198): <ul type="none">
<li style='text-indent:0pt; margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt;'"><i>	Prison
conditions were poor and did not meet international standards due to
overcrowding and the lack of sanitary facilities.  In
many cases prisoners
reportedly slept out out on concrete floors and often lacked natural light or
sufficient ventilation.  According
to prison officials and civil society sources
prisons designed for approximately 11,000 inmates held an estimated 32,000
prisoners.
 More than 11,000 of these prisoners were awaiting or undergoing
trial....Pre-trial detainees were often not held separately from
those
convicted....Authorities acknowledged poor prison conditions but noted a lack of
space and resources as determining factors.</i></li></ul></li>
<li style='text-indent:0pt; margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt;' value='13' value="13">The
material before the Tribunal also contained accounts given by asylum seekers
returned by Australia. One account was of returnees
held on remand in Negombo
prison:<ul type="none">
<li style='text-indent:0pt; margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt;'"><i>	They put us
with the murderers and the drug addicts&#8221; Mr Suresh said &#8220;We slept on
the floor in line, our bodies pressed
up against each other.  We could not roll
over.&#8221; In another cell another asylum seeker Balan said &#8220;Some
nights, we had
to take turns sleeping because there was no space.  One would sit
up while the other slept on the ground.  If you had money you could
pay a bribe
to get more space.</i></li></ul></li></ol><p align="right">(CB 226)</p>
<ol>
<li style='text-indent:0pt; margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt;' value='14' value="14">The
Tribunal accepted that there were substantial grounds for believing there is a
real risk that the applicant would be detained
in prison on return for up to
several nights because of his illegal departure (CB 208 at [91]).  The Tribunal
accepted that the conditions
in Negombo prison for previous detainees was very
cramped and that they were accommodated with people they perceived to be
&#8220;<i>murderers</i>&#8221; and &#8220;<i>drug addicts</i>&#8221;.  The
Tribunal accepted that these circumstances would be experienced by the applicant
as disturbing and very unpleasant (CB
227 at [70]).</li>
<li style='text-indent:0pt; margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt;' value='15' value="15">The
applicant&#8217;s adviser submitted that the treatment that the applicant was
likely to face in detention on return to Sri Lanka
would be both &#8220;<i>cruel
or inhuman treatment or punishment</i>&#8221; and &#8220;<i>degrading treatment
or punishment</i>&#8221; causing or intending to cause &#8220;<i>extreme
humiliation</i>&#8221; (CB 202).</li>
<li style='text-indent:0pt; margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt;' value='16' value="16">The
Tribunal addressed this submission as follows:<ul type="none">
<li style='text-indent:0pt; margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt;'"><i>	I have also
considered whether the applicant, by being detained and during his brief
detention might be subjected to cruel or inhuman
treatment or punishment.  As
noted above cruel or inhuman treatment or punishment is defined to mean an act
or omission by which

intentionally inflicted on a person, or pain or suffering, whether physical
or
mental, is intentionally inflicted on a person, so long as, in all the
circumstances, the act or omission could reasonably be

statutory definition of cruel and inhuman treatment and punishment is informed
by Australia&#8217;s international obligations
under the CAT and the ICCPR (see

<li style='text-indent:0pt; margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt;' value='20' value="20">The
content of those obligations is in turn informed by the decisions of the Human
Rights Committee established under the ICCPR (see

This is explicitly
accepted in the PAM 3 complimentary protection guidelines (see <i>Anochie
</i>(supra) at [22], [25]) which the Tribunal has been directed by the Minister
to take into account (Direction 54 made under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ma1958118/s499.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.499</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ma1958118/" class="autolink_findacts">Migration Act</a> and

Act</a>).</li>
<li style='text-indent:0pt; margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt;' value='21' value="21">Decisions
of the Human Rights Committee have accepted that detention with convicted
criminals in extremely cramped and unsanitary
conditions, even for a short
period of time, can constitute both cruel or inhuman treatment and punishment,
as well as degrading
treatment or punishment.  For example in <i>Portorreal v
Dominican Republic </i>Comm No 188/1984, UN Doc CCPR/C/OP/2 (5 November 1987),
the author &#8220;<i>was arrested...taken to a cell  at the secret service
police headquarters from where he was transferred to another cell measuring
20
by 5 metres where approximately 125 persons accused of common crimes were being
held, and where, owing to lack of space, some
detainees had to sit on excrement.
He received no food or water until the following day.  On 16 June 1984, after 50
hours of detention,
he was released.  At no time during his detention was he
informed of the reasons for his arrest.</i>&#8221;  The Human rights Committee
found that author&#8217;s treatment during his 50 hours of detention amounted to
both inhuman
and degrading treatment (<i>Portorreal </i>(supra) at [11]).</li>
<li style='text-indent:0pt; margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt;' value='22' value="22">Decisions
by the Human Rights Committee and examples given in the PAM 3 Guidelines
demonstrate that poor prison conditions  which
can amount to cruel or inhuman or
degrading treatment or punishment, include, inter alia, overcrowding; unsanitary
conditions; exposure
to cold (Human Rights Committee<i> Conteras v Uruguay</i>,
Comm No 1139/1983,  UN Doc Supp. No 40 A40/40 [17 July 1985]); inadequate
ventilation or lighting (Human Rights Committee <i>Brown v Jamaica</i>, Comm No
775/1997, UN Doc CCPR/C/65/D/775/1997 (23 March 1999)); inadequate bedding,
inadequate clothing, inadequate nutrition and
clean drinking water, lack of
opportunity for adequate exercise (Human Rights Committee <i>Mukong v
Cameroon</i>, Comm no 458/1991, UN Doc CCPR/C/51/D/458/1991 (21 July 1994);
<i>Mika Miha v Equatorial Guinea</i>, Comm No 414/1990 UN Doc

<li style='text-indent:0pt; margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt;' value='23' value="23">The
Tribunal accepted the conditions on remand in Negombo prison were overcrowded
and unsanitary as described in the report by Ben
Doherty in the Sydney Morning
Herald on 8 December 2012 (CB 226).  The conditions described in that report
included that:<ol type="a">
<li style='text-indent:0pt; margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt;' value='1'>remand
prisoners shared their cells with convicted murderers and drug offenders;</li>
<li style='text-indent:0pt; margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt;' value='2'>the
space in the cell was such that the prisoners had to sleep on the floor in line
with their bodies pressed against each other so
they could not roll over;
and</li></ol><ol type="i">
<li style='text-indent:0pt; margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt;' value='100'>in
another cell there was not even enough room for all the prisoners to lie down,
and some had to sit up;</li></ol></li>
<li style='text-indent:0pt; margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt;' value='24' value="24">These
conditions were of the sort found by the Human Rights Committee to be both
inhuman and degrading treatment.</li>
<li style='text-indent:0pt; margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt;' value='25' value="25">No
reference was made by the Tribunal to the fact that the PAM 3 guidelines
instructed the Tribunal to have regard to international
jurisprudence in
construing those terms.  No reference was made by the Tribunal to the various
examples of relevant international
jurisprudence that were extracted in the PAM
3 guidelines.   </li>
<li style='text-indent:0pt; margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt;' value='26' value="26">The
Tribunal made no attempt to grapple with the issues of how the prison conditions
of Negombo prison, as described in the Sydney
Morning Herald article, were
distinguishable from those found by the Human Rights Committee to amount to
degrading treatment or punishment.</li>
<li style='text-indent:0pt; margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt;' value='27' value="27">It
is quite clear that the type of prison conditions the Tribunal accepted that the
applicant would endure, even for a short period
of time, were capable of being
reasonably regarded as &#8220;<i>degrading treatment or punishment&#8221;
</i>and &#8220;<i>cruel or inhuman treatment or punishment</i>&#8221; within the
meaning of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ma1958118/s5.html" class="autolink_findacts">s5(1)</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ma1958118/" class="autolink_findacts">Migration Act</a> as exemplified by international
jurisprudence.  </li>
<li style='text-indent:0pt; margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt;' value='28' value="28">The
failure of the Tribunal to refer to this jurisprudence or the relevant parts of
the PAM 3 guidelines indicates that the Tribunal
misunderstood the applicable
law.</li>
<li style='text-indent:0pt; margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt;' value='29' value="29">
The Tribunal&#8217;s application of the definition to the facts before it could
not have been conducted according to law -because
it misunderstood the
applicable law.  </li>
<li style='text-indent:0pt; margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt;' value='30' value="30">Further,
the failure of the Tribunal to either specifically acknowledge or otherwise
demonstrate awareness of the direction in the
PAM 3 guidelines that it interpret
this part of the definition by reference to the international jurisprudence and
to refer to the
international jurisprudence considering when treatment would
constitute degrading treatment or punishment in breach of Article 7
of the ICCPR
demonstrates that the Tribunal did not, in substance, &#8220;<i>take into
account</i>&#8221;  those guidelines as required by  Direction 56 (see <i>WZAQU

<ol>
<li style='text-indent:0pt; margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt;' value='34' value="34"><a name="Heading171"></a>The
claim was made on behalf of the applicant by the applicant&#8217;s adviser in
her submissions to the delegate of 5 October 2012.
The claim is set out on page
76 of Exhibit A1 in the fifth dot point under the heading &#8220;<i>Why would Mr
[S] be at risk on return to Sri Lanka?</i>&#8221;.</li>
<li style='text-indent:0pt; margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt;' value='35' value="35">The
imputation was claimed to arise because the applicant&#8217;s family had a
history of supporting pro Tamil parties.  His step
father was imprisoned and
tortured in the past because of his involvement with the EPDP and his uncle has
also stood for election
in 2010 for the Tamil National Alliance
(&#8220;TNA&#8221;) and his step brother helped him campaign.</li>
<li style='text-indent:0pt; margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt;' value='36' value="36">It
is submitted that it is unambiguously a claim of fear of persecution for imputed
political opinion which is distinct to that of
being an imputed LTTE supporter. 
The claim is made separately from the fear of persecution for an imputed
political opinion as an
LTTE supporter (which is the claim made in the third dot
point on the same page).</li>
<li style='text-indent:0pt; margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt;' value='37' value="37">
It is submitted that it is a claim that is clearly articulated.  It arose
squarely for consideration.</li>
<li style='text-indent:0pt; margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt;' value='38' value="38">In
the adviser&#8217;s submission to the Tribunal at CB 192 the imputed political
opinion claim is again stated as having 2 aspects
&#8220;suspected LTTE
links&#8221; and &#8220;an opponent of the ruling party&#8221; (second dot point
under the heading <i>claims</i>).</li>
<li style='text-indent:0pt; margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt;' value='39' value="39">It
is well established that a failure by the Tribunal to consider a claim which, if
sustained, might lead to a finding in the applicant&#8217;s
favour, will be a
failure to complete the exercise of the Tribunal&#8217;s jurisdiction and a
jurisdictional error (see <i>Htun v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural
Affairs </i>(2001) 194 ALR 244).  This claim has these attributes. </li>
<li style='text-indent:0pt; margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt;' value='40' value="40">There
is no reference to the claim in the Tribunal&#8217;s decision.</li>
<li style='text-indent:0pt; margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt;' value='41' value="41">
The Tribunal characterises the applicant&#8217;s imputed political opinion claim
as being wholly attributable to imputed LTTE support.
 At CB 219 Tribunal at
[18] characterises the applicant&#8217;s claim as fearing persecution for being
imputed with a political opinion
relating to links with the LTTE. </li>
<li style='text-indent:0pt; margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt;' value='42' value="42">The
Tribunal was satisfied that the applicant&#8217;s credibility was not an issue
in the matter (CB p.217).  The claim was thus not
impliedly disposed of by
adverse credit findings.</li>
<li style='text-indent:0pt; margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt;' value='43' value="43">

<ol>
<li style='text-indent:0pt; margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt;' value='50' value="50"><a name="Heading189"></a>The
proposed further amended application contains three grounds, all concerning the
Tribunal&#8217;s complementary protection findings.</li>
<li style='text-indent:0pt; margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt;' value='51' value="51">The
first ground claims that the Tribunal &#8220;<i>erred in its understanding on
what was degrading treatment or punishment and cruel or inhuman treatment or
punishment</i>&#8221;, but does not indicate how the Tribunal is said to have so
erred.  The applicant&#8217;s submissions complain that the Tribunal
did not
refer to international authorities, especially decisions of the United Nations
Human Rights Committee concerning prison conditions,
albeit not those in Sri
Lanka.  However as pointed out in <i>Minister for Immigration and Citizenship v
MZYYL</i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCAFC/2012/147.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases_inserted">[2012] FCAFC 147</a>;  <a href="/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%282012%29%20207%20FCR%20211" title="View LawCiteRecord" class="autolink_findcases">(2012) 207 FCR 211</a> at  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCAFC/2012/147.html#para18" class="autolink_findcases">[18]</a>- <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCAFC/2012/147.html#para20" class="autolink_findcases">[20]</a> the complementary protection
provisions are a code and use language different from those contained in
international human rights
treaties.  The Tribunal correctly applied the terms
of the legislation, consistently with <i>MZYYL</i> (supra) at [20]; see
similarly <i>SZSPE v Minister for Immigration and Border Protection</i>  <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCA/2014/267.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">[2014]
FCA 267</a> per Yates J at [40]-[43].  The Minister submits this ground fails.</li>
<li style='text-indent:0pt; margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt;' value='52' value="52">Ground
two claims that the Tribunal failed to apply the PAM 3 Complementary Protection
Guidelines, as required by Direction 56 made
under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ma1958118/s499.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.499</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ma1958118/" class="autolink_findacts">Migration Act</a>. 
The Tribunal notes at [11] (CB 218) that it is bound by the Direction and states
that it has taken the PAM 3 Complementary Protection
guidelines into account to
the extent that they are relevant.  That is all that clause 2 of Direction 56
requires.  Contrary to the
applicant&#8217;s submissions, the PAM 3 guidelines
do not require the Tribunal to engage in some explicit consideration of possibly
relevant international authorities in every case.  Firstly, the Direction cannot
be inconsistent with the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ma1958118/" class="autolink_findacts">Migration Act</a>: <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ma1958118/s499.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.499(2)</a>, so the construction of the
complementary protection provisions in <i>MZYYL</i> (supra) and <i>SZSPE</i>
(supra) cannot have been altered by the Direction.  And secondly, the decisions
of the Human Rights Committee cited in the Applicant&#8217;s
submissions do not
concern Sri Lanka and at most indicate that prison conditions may breach
provisions of international human rights
treaties.  The Tribunal nowhere denies
that it is possible that prison conditions in Sri Lanka could amount to
&#8220;significant
harm&#8221; as defined in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ma1958118/s5.html" class="autolink_findacts">ss.5(1)</a> and <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ma1958118/s36.html" class="autolink_findacts">36</a>(2A) of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ma1958118/" class="autolink_findacts">Migration
Act</a>, so there is nothing in its reasoning inconsistent with the decisions cited
in the applicant&#8217;s submissions.  Rather the Tribunal
at [69]-[73] (CB
226-227) has not been satisfied on the evidence before it that the conditions
which there was a real chance that
the Applicant might experience in detention
could be said to be sufficiently severe to fall within the definition.  This is
a factual
conclusion which does not reveal any error: see similarly <i>SZSYP</i>
(supra) at [44].  As the applicant has not established that the Tribunal failed
to take account of the PAM 3 guidelines to the extent
that they are relevant
this ground fails.</li>
<li style='text-indent:0pt; margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt;' value='53' value="53">Ground
three complains that the Tribunal failed to take into account a relevant
consideration, which fails for the same reasons as
ground two.</li>
<li style='text-indent:0pt; margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt;' value='54' value="54">Ground
four of the application asserts the Tribunal failed to address a claim of
persecution for imputed political opinion as a supporter
of pro-Tamil political
parties.</li>
<li style='text-indent:0pt; margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt;' value='55' value="55">The
applicant claimed in written submissions before the delegate to fear harm
because of &#8220;<i>his family history of supporting pro-Tamil political
parties</i>&#8221; (CB 76.8), noting activities of his stepfather, uncle and
stepbrother.  The applicant did not himself claim to be a supporter
of such
parties, or to have repeated the claim before the Tribunal.  Rather, he claimed
in written submissions before the Tribunal
to fear persecution on the Convention
ground of imputed political opinion (suspected LTTE links) and as an
&#8220;<i>opponent of the Ruling party</i>&#8221; (CB 192.3), but does not
appear to have explained why he would be perceived as an &#8220;<i>opponent of
the Ruling party</i>&#8221;.</li>
<li style='text-indent:0pt; margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt;' value='56' value="56">The
Tribunal characterised the applicant&#8217;s claim relying on imputed political
opinion as &#8220;<i>he fears being imputed with a political opinion relating to
links to the LTTE</i>&#8221; (CB 219 at [18]).  The Tribunal noted the
applicant&#8217;s oral evidence that he did not know of anyone in his family or
step-family who had been involved with or supported the LTTE, although his
stepfather had had to lend them a vehicle and the family
had been forced to
provide food (CB 220 at [31]).  The applicant does not appear to have made any
reference to a family history of
supporting pro-Tamil political parties or being
an opponent of the Ruling party at the hearing (CB 222 at [47]).</li>
<li style='text-indent:0pt; margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt;' value='57' value="57">In
the circumstance there was no &#8220;substantial, clearly articulated argument
relying upon established facts&#8221; with <i>Dranichnikov v Minister for
Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs </i>(2003) 77 ALJR 1088 at
[24] that the applicant feared harm because of an imputed political opinion
distinct from his claim to fear
harm as having suspected LTTE links.  There was
no fact basis established for such a claim, nor any clear articulation of it,
beyond
the vague assertions in the applicant&#8217;s submissions noted above. 
It was therefore not a claim that the Tribunal was required
to address: <i>NABE

Sri Lanka for up to several
nights as a result of his illegal departure from Sri Lanka (CB 226).  It then
went on to make conclusive
findings as to whether this detention would amount to
significant harm for the purposes of the complementary protection criterion

protection regime provides criteria for the grant of a protection visa in
circumstances where the minister is
not satisfied that Australia has protection
obligations to that non-citizen under the Refugees Convention. The regime
establishes
criteria &#8220;that engage&#8221; Australia&#8217;s express and
implied non-refoulement obligations under the International Covenant
on Civil
and Political Rights (ICCPR), the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel,
Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
(CAT) and the Convention on the
Rights of the Child (CROC) (collectively the International Human Rights
Treaties): Commonwealth,
Parliamentary Debates, House of Representatives, 24
February 2011, 1357 (Chris Bowen, Minister for Immigration and Citizenship).
The
complementary protection regime is a code in the sense that the relevant
criteria and obligations are defined in it and it contains
its own definitions:
see, by way of example, the definitions in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ma1958118/s5.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 5</a> of the Act of
&#8220;torture&#8221; and &#8220;cruel or inhuman treatment or

defined by reference to a relevant international law. Moreover, the
complementary protection
regime uses definitions and tests
</i><a name="PAGE_469"></a><a name="TAABAAE"></a><i>different from those
referred to in the International Human Rights Treaties and the commentaries on
those International Human Rights
Treaties. For example, the definition of
&#8220;torture&#8221; in the complementary protection regime is different from
that in the
CAT: see <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ma1958118/s5.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 5(1)</a> of the Act, Art 1 of the CAT and the explanatory
memorandum in relation to the Bill at [52]. Further, the International Human
Rights
Treaties do not require the non-citizen to establish that the non-citizen
could not avail himself or herself of the protection of
the receiving country or
that the non-citizen could not relocate within that country. <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ma1958118/s36.html" class="autolink_findacts">Section 36(2B)(a)</a>

considered the applicant&#8217;s

given that the Tribunal expressly referred to its obligations under the

persuaded that it can be inferred from the way the Tribunal expressed itself in

it did not consider the CP Guidelines. Those guidelines do
not purport to define the component elements of &#8220;significant harm&#8220;.
Rather, they discuss matters which may be taken into consideration when
determining whether a particular circumstance amounts to
significant harm.
Consequently, the Tribunal was not wrong to say that the terms were defined by
the statute, not least because s.499(2)
subordinated the ministerial direction
to the terms of the Act.</i></li>

that the

jurisprudence to which the applicant particularly
referred was cited in that
paragraph of the CP Guidelines, I conclude that the Tribunal&#8217;s
consideration of that paragraph included
a consideration of the international
jurisprudence referred to there. The Tribunal was not relevantly required to do
more. Neither
the ministerial direction nor the CP Guidelines required the
Tribunal to look first at the guidelines and then separately at international
cases. The guidelines simply required the Tribunal to have regard to
international jurisprudence. As that jurisprudence was set out

<li style='text-indent:0pt; margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt;' value='82' value="82">Having
regard to the above extracts from the Court Book and Decision Record, I accept
the Minister&#8217;s submission that there was
no &#8220;substantial, clearly
articulated argument relying upon established facts&#8221; in the manner set out
in <i>Dranichnikov </i>(supra) at [24] that the applicant feared harm based on
an imputed political opinion as distinct from his claim to fear harm as a
result
of having suspected LTTE links.  </li>

</i><i>Although such a claim might have been seen as arising on the material
before the tribunal it did not represent, in any way, &#8220;a
substantial
clearly articulated argument relying upon established facts&#8221; in the sense
in which that term was used in Dranichnikov.
A judgment that the tribunal has
failed to consider a claim not expressly advanced is, as already indicated in
these reasons, not
lightly to be made. The claim must emerge clearly from the
materials before the tribunal. In our opinion the judgment that the tribunal,
by
reason of the error it made about the appellant&#8217;s involvement with PLOTE,
failed to consider an unexpressed claim of want
of effective state protection
against persecution by PLOTE, is not open having regard to the thresholds
required for such a judgment
by the authorities to which we have referred. This
case does demonstrate an unfortunate factual error which, as Tamberlin J found,
contributed to the tribunal&#8217;s adverse finding as to credibility and could
have affected the outcome of the review by the tribunal.
It did not, however,
constitute jurisdictional error in the sense earlier discussed. It was, as the
members of the Full Court found
on the first occasion, an error of fact within
jurisdiction.</i></li></ul></li>
<li style='text-indent:0pt; margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt;' value='84' value="84">I
am not satisfied a substantial clearly articulated argument relying upon
established facts was advanced by the applicant as contended.
 Accordingly,
there was not a claim before the Tribunal that it was required to address.  This
ground cannot be sustained and should
be dismissed.</li></ol>

<ol>
<li style='text-indent:0pt; margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt;' value='85' value="85"><a name="Heading315"></a>On
3 September 2014, the Federal Court of Australia delivered judgment in the
matter <i>WZAPN v Minister for Immigration and Border Protection </i> <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCA/2014/947.html" title="View Case" class="autolink_findcases">[2014] FCA
947</a> per North J.</li>
<li style='text-indent:0pt; margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt;' value='86' value="86">On
1 October 2014, the Minister filed in the High Court of Australia an Application
for Special Leave to Appeal from the judgment
of North J in <i>WZAPN
</i>(supra).  Consequently, as other proceedings addressing this specific issue
had requested the reserved judgment not be finalised until
the High Court
decision was known, I have adopted that approach for this current matter.</li>
<li style='text-indent:0pt; margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt;' value='87' value="87">Failed
Protection visa applicants of Tamil ethnicity returning to Sri Lanka voluntarily
or by escort on temporary travel documents
from a Western country will be
questioned by the authorities and may be arrested and held on remand for a few
days whilst waiting
for a court appearance facing charges including possible
breaches of the <i>Immigration and Emigration Act 1949</i>.   Various country
reports together with a Sydney Morning Herald article of 8-9 December 2012
indicate that people are detained possibly
for 3 days after which they are
bailed for a future court appearance.  The hearing may levy a fine based on a
law of general application
relating to illegal departure from Sri Lanka. 
Country information indicates that there is some evidence demonstrating that the
law
is discriminatorily applied to people of Tamil ethnicity.  As the entry
point is usually Colombo, remand would be served in Negombo
Prison which is
cramped and unsanitary.  The question arises as to whether being questioned,
detained for up to 3 days and significant
fines are of the type and seriousness
of harm amounting to persecution as meant by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ma1958118/s91r.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.91R</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ma1958118/" class="autolink_findacts">Migration Act</a>. </li>
<li style='text-indent:0pt; margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt;' value='88' value="88">In
<i>WZAPN</i> (supra), North J held that the application of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ma1958118/s91r.html" class="autolink_findacts">s.91R</a> did not permit
a quantitative assessment of the nature of the harm required to be considered by
that section.   His Honour described
the approach taken by the Reviewer at [18],
where he states: <ul type="none">
<li style='text-indent:0pt; margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt;'"><i>	18. The
reviewer accepted that there was a real chance that the applicant would be
questioned periodically and probably detained
for short periods when he failed
to provide identification, but held that the frequency and length of the
detention, and the nature
of the treatment he would receive in detention, did
not amount to serious harm within <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ma1958118/s91r.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 91R(2)(a)</a>, (b) or (c). The reviewer
concluded that on this analysis, the nature of the detention was not
sufficiently significant and thus
did not constitute serious harm ... In
approaching the matter in this way, the reviewer made a qualitative assessment
of the nature
of the harm caused by the detention.</i></li></ul></li>
<li style='text-indent:0pt; margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt;' value='89' value="89">The
argument was recorded by his Honour as:<ul type="none">
<li style='text-indent:0pt; margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt;'"><i>	20.
 The applicant contended in his original written submissions, and in oral
submissions, that the reviewer wrongly applied a qualitative
assessment to the
nature of the harm. The applicant argued that <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ma1958118/s91r.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 91R(2)(a)</a> is concerned with
the threat, in the sense of a risk, of harm to life and liberty, whatever the
nature of the harm. Whether there
is a threat depends on an assessment of the
likelihood of harm happening. But once that threat is established,
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ma1958118/s91r.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 91R(2)(a)</a> operates so that the threat to life or liberty amounts to
serious harm irrespective of the nature or extent of the potential harm
to life
or liberty. Thus, there is no place for an assessment of the frequency or degree
of the harm, or the circumstances which
attend such harm, save only for a de
minimus exclusion. Consequently, once the reviewer found that the applicant was
at risk of detention,
serious harm was established within the meaning of
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ma1958118/s91r.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 91R(2)(a)</a> irrespective of the significance of the circumstances attending
the detention.</i></li></ul></li>
<li style='text-indent:0pt; margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt;' value='90' value="90">That
argument was accepted by his Honour at [30], [44] and [45] where his Honour

aspect of the structure of <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ma1958118/s91r.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 91R(1)</a>, which we have touched on above,
concerns the fact that it contains three separate and cumulative conditions for
persecution to be
established for the purposes of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ma1958118/" class="autolink_findacts">Migration Act</a> and the
regulations, of which the requirement of serious harm is only one. We
acknowledge that matters such as the length of detention,
its frequency, purpose
and character may also arise in determining whether the reason for the
detention, which must be a Convention
reason, is the essential and significant
reason for the persecution (as required by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ma1958118/s91r.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 91R(1)(a))</a> or involves
systematic and discriminatory conduct (as required by <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ma1958118/s91r.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 91R(1)(c)).</a>
However, this does not mean that such matters may not also arise for
consideration and evaluation in relation to the requirement
of serious harm
within <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ma1958118/s91r.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 91R(1)(b).</a></i></li>

</i><i> Unlike North J in WZAPN, we do not consider the absence
of adjectival qualification in <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ma1958118/s91r.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 91R(2)(a)</a> to be of significance, given the
context of the provision as a whole. Rather, the absence of an adjective
indicates that a threat
to &#8220;liberty&#8220; is not synonymous with the
possibility of a person being held briefly on remand or detained for a short
time for questioning. In this context, &#8220;liberty&#8220; is a nuanced
concept which takes its meaning from the context in which
it appears, namely the
requirement that the persecution involve serious harm, as is made clear in
<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ma1958118/s91r.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 91R(1).</a></i></li>

<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ma1958118/s91r.html" class="autolink_findacts">s 91R(2)</a> supports a construction of that provision to the effect
that</i> any <i>threat to liberty constitutes serious harm without
reference to the severity of the threat to liberty. As Dixon CJ observed in
